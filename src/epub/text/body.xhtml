<p id="id00017" style="margin-top: 2em">Of Man's first disobedience, and the fruit<br/>

Of that forbidden tree whose mortal taste<br/>

Brought death into the World, and all our woe,<br/>

With loss of Eden, till one greater Man<br/>

Restore us, and regain the blissful seat,<br/>

Sing, Heavenly Muse, that, on the secret top<br/>

Of Oreb, or of Sinai, didst inspire<br/>

That shepherd who first taught the chosen seed<br/>

In the beginning how the heavens and earth<br/>

Rose out of Chaos: or, if Sion hill<br/>

Delight thee more, and Siloa's brook that flowed<br/>

Fast by the oracle of God, I thence<br/>

Invoke thy aid to my adventurous song,<br/>

That with no middle flight intends to soar<br/>

Above th' Aonian mount, while it pursues<br/>

Things unattempted yet in prose or rhyme.<br/>

And chiefly thou, O Spirit, that dost prefer<br/>

Before all temples th' upright heart and pure,<br/>

Instruct me, for thou know'st; thou from the first<br/>

Wast present, and, with mighty wings outspread,<br/>

Dove-like sat'st brooding on the vast Abyss,<br/>

And mad'st it pregnant: what in me is dark<br/>

Illumine, what is low raise and support;<br/>

That, to the height of this great argument,<br/>

I may assert Eternal Providence,<br/>

And justify the ways of God to men.<br/>

  Say first—for Heaven hides nothing from thy view,<br/>

Nor the deep tract of Hell—say first what cause<br/>

Moved our grand parents, in that happy state,<br/>

Favoured of Heaven so highly, to fall off<br/>

From their Creator, and transgress his will<br/>

For one restraint, lords of the World besides.<br/>

Who first seduced them to that foul revolt?<br/>

  Th' infernal Serpent; he it was whose guile,<br/>

Stirred up with envy and revenge, deceived<br/>

The mother of mankind, what time his pride<br/>

Had cast him out from Heaven, with all his host<br/>

Of rebel Angels, by whose aid, aspiring<br/>

To set himself in glory above his peers,<br/>

He trusted to have equalled the Most High,<br/>

If he opposed, and with ambitious aim<br/>

Against the throne and monarchy of God,<br/>

Raised impious war in Heaven and battle proud,<br/>

With vain attempt.  Him the Almighty Power<br/>

Hurled headlong flaming from th' ethereal sky,<br/>

With hideous ruin and combustion, down<br/>

To bottomless perdition, there to dwell<br/>

In adamantine chains and penal fire,<br/>

Who durst defy th' Omnipotent to arms.<br/>

  Nine times the space that measures day and night<br/>

To mortal men, he, with his horrid crew,<br/>

Lay vanquished, rolling in the fiery gulf,<br/>

Confounded, though immortal.  But his doom<br/>

Reserved him to more wrath; for now the thought<br/>

Both of lost happiness and lasting pain<br/>

Torments him: round he throws his baleful eyes,<br/>

That witnessed huge affliction and dismay,<br/>

Mixed with obdurate pride and steadfast hate.<br/>

At once, as far as Angels ken, he views<br/>

The dismal situation waste and wild.<br/>

A dungeon horrible, on all sides round,<br/>

As one great furnace flamed; yet from those flames<br/>

No light; but rather darkness visible<br/>

Served only to discover sights of woe,<br/>

Regions of sorrow, doleful shades, where peace<br/>

And rest can never dwell, hope never comes<br/>

That comes to all, but torture without end<br/>

Still urges, and a fiery deluge, fed<br/>

With ever-burning sulphur unconsumed.<br/>

Such place Eternal Justice has prepared<br/>

For those rebellious; here their prison ordained<br/>

In utter darkness, and their portion set,<br/>

As far removed from God and light of Heaven<br/>

As from the centre thrice to th' utmost pole.<br/>

Oh how unlike the place from whence they fell!<br/>

There the companions of his fall, o'erwhelmed<br/>

With floods and whirlwinds of tempestuous fire,<br/>

He soon discerns; and, weltering by his side,<br/>

One next himself in power, and next in crime,<br/>

Long after known in Palestine, and named<br/>

Beelzebub.  To whom th' Arch-Enemy,<br/>

And thence in Heaven called Satan, with bold words<br/>

Breaking the horrid silence, thus began:—<br/>

  "If thou beest he—but O how fallen! how changed<br/>

From him who, in the happy realms of light<br/>

Clothed with transcendent brightness, didst outshine<br/>

Myriads, though bright!—if he whom mutual league,<br/>

United thoughts and counsels, equal hope<br/>

And hazard in the glorious enterprise<br/>

Joined with me once, now misery hath joined<br/>

In equal ruin; into what pit thou seest<br/>

From what height fallen: so much the stronger proved<br/>

He with his thunder; and till then who knew<br/>

The force of those dire arms?  Yet not for those,<br/>

Nor what the potent Victor in his rage<br/>

Can else inflict, do I repent, or change,<br/>

Though changed in outward lustre, that fixed mind,<br/>

And high disdain from sense of injured merit,<br/>

That with the Mightiest raised me to contend,<br/>

And to the fierce contentions brought along<br/>

Innumerable force of Spirits armed,<br/>

That durst dislike his reign, and, me preferring,<br/>

His utmost power with adverse power opposed<br/>

In dubious battle on the plains of Heaven,<br/>

And shook his throne.  What though the field be lost?<br/>

All is not lost—the unconquerable will,<br/>

And study of revenge, immortal hate,<br/>

And courage never to submit or yield:<br/>

And what is else not to be overcome?<br/>

That glory never shall his wrath or might<br/>

Extort from me.  To bow and sue for grace<br/>

With suppliant knee, and deify his power<br/>

Who, from the terror of this arm, so late<br/>

Doubted his empire—that were low indeed;<br/>

That were an ignominy and shame beneath<br/>

This downfall; since, by fate, the strength of Gods,<br/>

And this empyreal substance, cannot fail;<br/>

Since, through experience of this great event,<br/>

In arms not worse, in foresight much advanced,<br/>

We may with more successful hope resolve<br/>

To wage by force or guile eternal war,<br/>

Irreconcilable to our grand Foe,<br/>

Who now triumphs, and in th' excess of joy<br/>

Sole reigning holds the tyranny of Heaven."<br/>

  So spake th' apostate Angel, though in pain,<br/>

Vaunting aloud, but racked with deep despair;<br/>

And him thus answered soon his bold compeer:—<br/>

  "O Prince, O Chief of many throned Powers<br/>

That led th' embattled Seraphim to war<br/>

Under thy conduct, and, in dreadful deeds<br/>

Fearless, endangered Heaven's perpetual King,<br/>

And put to proof his high supremacy,<br/>

Whether upheld by strength, or chance, or fate,<br/>

Too well I see and rue the dire event<br/>

That, with sad overthrow and foul defeat,<br/>

Hath lost us Heaven, and all this mighty host<br/>

In horrible destruction laid thus low,<br/>

As far as Gods and heavenly Essences<br/>

Can perish: for the mind and spirit remains<br/>

Invincible, and vigour soon returns,<br/>

Though all our glory extinct, and happy state<br/>

Here swallowed up in endless misery.<br/>

But what if he our Conqueror (whom I now<br/>

Of force believe almighty, since no less<br/>

Than such could have o'erpowered such force as ours)<br/>

Have left us this our spirit and strength entire,<br/>

Strongly to suffer and support our pains,<br/>

That we may so suffice his vengeful ire,<br/>

Or do him mightier service as his thralls<br/>

By right of war, whate'er his business be,<br/>

Here in the heart of Hell to work in fire,<br/>

Or do his errands in the gloomy Deep?<br/>

What can it the avail though yet we feel<br/>

Strength undiminished, or eternal being<br/>

To undergo eternal punishment?"<br/>

  Whereto with speedy words th' Arch-Fiend replied:—<br/>

"Fallen Cherub, to be weak is miserable,<br/>

Doing or suffering: but of this be sure—<br/>

To do aught good never will be our task,<br/>

But ever to do ill our sole delight,<br/>

As being the contrary to his high will<br/>

Whom we resist.  If then his providence<br/>

Out of our evil seek to bring forth good,<br/>

Our labour must be to pervert that end,<br/>

And out of good still to find means of evil;<br/>

Which ofttimes may succeed so as perhaps<br/>

Shall grieve him, if I fail not, and disturb<br/>

His inmost counsels from their destined aim.<br/>

But see! the angry Victor hath recalled<br/>

His ministers of vengeance and pursuit<br/>

Back to the gates of Heaven: the sulphurous hail,<br/>

Shot after us in storm, o'erblown hath laid<br/>

The fiery surge that from the precipice<br/>

Of Heaven received us falling; and the thunder,<br/>

Winged with red lightning and impetuous rage,<br/>

Perhaps hath spent his shafts, and ceases now<br/>

To bellow through the vast and boundless Deep.<br/>

Let us not slip th' occasion, whether scorn<br/>

Or satiate fury yield it from our Foe.<br/>

Seest thou yon dreary plain, forlorn and wild,<br/>

The seat of desolation, void of light,<br/>

Save what the glimmering of these livid flames<br/>

Casts pale and dreadful? Thither let us tend<br/>

From off the tossing of these fiery waves;<br/>

There rest, if any rest can harbour there;<br/>

And, re-assembling our afflicted powers,<br/>

Consult how we may henceforth most offend<br/>

Our enemy, our own loss how repair,<br/>

How overcome this dire calamity,<br/>

What reinforcement we may gain from hope,<br/>

If not, what resolution from despair."<br/>

  Thus Satan, talking to his nearest mate,<br/>

With head uplift above the wave, and eyes<br/>

That sparkling blazed; his other parts besides<br/>

Prone on the flood, extended long and large,<br/>

Lay floating many a rood, in bulk as huge<br/>

As whom the fables name of monstrous size,<br/>

Titanian or Earth-born, that warred on Jove,<br/>

Briareos or Typhon, whom the den<br/>

By ancient Tarsus held, or that sea-beast<br/>

Leviathan, which God of all his works<br/>

Created hugest that swim th' ocean-stream.<br/>

Him, haply slumbering on the Norway foam,<br/>

The pilot of some small night-foundered skiff,<br/>

Deeming some island, oft, as seamen tell,<br/>

With fixed anchor in his scaly rind,<br/>

Moors by his side under the lee, while night<br/>

Invests the sea, and wished morn delays.<br/>

So stretched out huge in length the Arch-fiend lay,<br/>

Chained on the burning lake; nor ever thence<br/>

Had risen, or heaved his head, but that the will<br/>

And high permission of all-ruling Heaven<br/>

Left him at large to his own dark designs,<br/>

That with reiterated crimes he might<br/>

Heap on himself damnation, while he sought<br/>

Evil to others, and enraged might see<br/>

How all his malice served but to bring forth<br/>

Infinite goodness, grace, and mercy, shewn<br/>

On Man by him seduced, but on himself<br/>

Treble confusion, wrath, and vengeance poured.<br/>

  Forthwith upright he rears from off the pool<br/>

His mighty stature; on each hand the flames<br/>

Driven backward slope their pointing spires, and rolled<br/>

In billows, leave i' th' midst a horrid vale.<br/>

Then with expanded wings he steers his flight<br/>

Aloft, incumbent on the dusky air,<br/>

That felt unusual weight; till on dry land<br/>

He lights—if it were land that ever burned<br/>

With solid, as the lake with liquid fire,<br/>

And such appeared in hue as when the force<br/>

Of subterranean wind transports a hill<br/>

Torn from Pelorus, or the shattered side<br/>

Of thundering Etna, whose combustible<br/>

And fuelled entrails, thence conceiving fire,<br/>

Sublimed with mineral fury, aid the winds,<br/>

And leave a singed bottom all involved<br/>

With stench and smoke.  Such resting found the sole<br/>

Of unblest feet.  Him followed his next mate;<br/>

Both glorying to have scaped the Stygian flood<br/>

As gods, and by their own recovered strength,<br/>

Not by the sufferance of supernal Power.<br/>

  "Is this the region, this the soil, the clime,"<br/>

Said then the lost Archangel, "this the seat<br/>

That we must change for Heaven?—this mournful gloom<br/>

For that celestial light? Be it so, since he<br/>

Who now is sovereign can dispose and bid<br/>

What shall be right: farthest from him is best<br/>

Whom reason hath equalled, force hath made supreme<br/>

Above his equals.  Farewell, happy fields,<br/>

Where joy for ever dwells! Hail, horrors! hail,<br/>

Infernal world! and thou, profoundest Hell,<br/>

Receive thy new possessor—one who brings<br/>

A mind not to be changed by place or time.<br/>

The mind is its own place, and in itself<br/>

Can make a Heaven of Hell, a Hell of Heaven.<br/>

What matter where, if I be still the same,<br/>

And what I should be, all but less than he<br/>

Whom thunder hath made greater? Here at least<br/>

We shall be free; th' Almighty hath not built<br/>

Here for his envy, will not drive us hence:<br/>

Here we may reign secure; and, in my choice,<br/>

To reign is worth ambition, though in Hell:<br/>

Better to reign in Hell than serve in Heaven.<br/>

But wherefore let we then our faithful friends,<br/>

Th' associates and co-partners of our loss,<br/>

Lie thus astonished on th' oblivious pool,<br/>

And call them not to share with us their part<br/>

In this unhappy mansion, or once more<br/>

With rallied arms to try what may be yet<br/>

Regained in Heaven, or what more lost in Hell?"<br/>

  So Satan spake; and him Beelzebub<br/>

Thus answered:—"Leader of those armies bright<br/>

Which, but th' Omnipotent, none could have foiled!<br/>

If once they hear that voice, their liveliest pledge<br/>

Of hope in fears and dangers—heard so oft<br/>

In worst extremes, and on the perilous edge<br/>

Of battle, when it raged, in all assaults<br/>

Their surest signal—they will soon resume<br/>

New courage and revive, though now they lie<br/>

Grovelling and prostrate on yon lake of fire,<br/>

As we erewhile, astounded and amazed;<br/>

No wonder, fallen such a pernicious height!"<br/>

  He scarce had ceased when the superior Fiend<br/>

Was moving toward the shore; his ponderous shield,<br/>

Ethereal temper, massy, large, and round,<br/>

Behind him cast.  The broad circumference<br/>

Hung on his shoulders like the moon, whose orb<br/>

Through optic glass the Tuscan artist views<br/>

At evening, from the top of Fesole,<br/>

Or in Valdarno, to descry new lands,<br/>

Rivers, or mountains, in her spotty globe.<br/>

His spear—to equal which the tallest pine<br/>

Hewn on Norwegian hills, to be the mast<br/>

Of some great ammiral, were but a wand—<br/>

He walked with, to support uneasy steps<br/>

Over the burning marl, not like those steps<br/>

On Heaven's azure; and the torrid clime<br/>

Smote on him sore besides, vaulted with fire.<br/>

Nathless he so endured, till on the beach<br/>

Of that inflamed sea he stood, and called<br/>

His legions—Angel Forms, who lay entranced<br/>

Thick as autumnal leaves that strow the brooks<br/>

In Vallombrosa, where th' Etrurian shades<br/>

High over-arched embower; or scattered sedge<br/>

Afloat, when with fierce winds Orion armed<br/>

Hath vexed the Red-Sea coast, whose waves o'erthrew<br/>

Busiris and his Memphian chivalry,<br/>

While with perfidious hatred they pursued<br/>

The sojourners of Goshen, who beheld<br/>

From the safe shore their floating carcases<br/>

And broken chariot-wheels.  So thick bestrown,<br/>

Abject and lost, lay these, covering the flood,<br/>

Under amazement of their hideous change.<br/>

He called so loud that all the hollow deep<br/>

Of Hell resounded:—"Princes, Potentates,<br/>

Warriors, the Flower of Heaven—once yours; now lost,<br/>

If such astonishment as this can seize<br/>

Eternal Spirits! Or have ye chosen this place<br/>

After the toil of battle to repose<br/>

Your wearied virtue, for the ease you find<br/>

To slumber here, as in the vales of Heaven?<br/>

Or in this abject posture have ye sworn<br/>

To adore the Conqueror, who now beholds<br/>

Cherub and Seraph rolling in the flood<br/>

With scattered arms and ensigns, till anon<br/>

His swift pursuers from Heaven-gates discern<br/>

Th' advantage, and, descending, tread us down<br/>

Thus drooping, or with linked thunderbolts<br/>

Transfix us to the bottom of this gulf?<br/>

Awake, arise, or be for ever fallen!"<br/>

  They heard, and were abashed, and up they sprung<br/>

Upon the wing, as when men wont to watch<br/>

On duty, sleeping found by whom they dread,<br/>

Rouse and bestir themselves ere well awake.<br/>

Nor did they not perceive the evil plight<br/>

In which they were, or the fierce pains not feel;<br/>

Yet to their General's voice they soon obeyed<br/>

Innumerable.  As when the potent rod<br/>

Of Amram's son, in Egypt's evil day,<br/>

Waved round the coast, up-called a pitchy cloud<br/>

Of locusts, warping on the eastern wind,<br/>

That o'er the realm of impious Pharaoh hung<br/>

Like Night, and darkened all the land of Nile;<br/>

So numberless were those bad Angels seen<br/>

Hovering on wing under the cope of Hell,<br/>

'Twixt upper, nether, and surrounding fires;<br/>

Till, as a signal given, th' uplifted spear<br/>

Of their great Sultan waving to direct<br/>

Their course, in even balance down they light<br/>

On the firm brimstone, and fill all the plain:<br/>

A multitude like which the populous North<br/>

Poured never from her frozen loins to pass<br/>

Rhene or the Danaw, when her barbarous sons<br/>

Came like a deluge on the South, and spread<br/>

Beneath Gibraltar to the Libyan sands.<br/>

Forthwith, form every squadron and each band,<br/>

The heads and leaders thither haste where stood<br/>

Their great Commander—godlike Shapes, and Forms<br/>

Excelling human; princely Dignities;<br/>

And Powers that erst in Heaven sat on thrones,<br/>

Though on their names in Heavenly records now<br/>

Be no memorial, blotted out and rased<br/>

By their rebellion from the Books of Life.<br/>

Nor had they yet among the sons of Eve<br/>

Got them new names, till, wandering o'er the earth,<br/>

Through God's high sufferance for the trial of man,<br/>

By falsities and lies the greatest part<br/>

Of mankind they corrupted to forsake<br/>

God their Creator, and th' invisible<br/>

Glory of him that made them to transform<br/>

Oft to the image of a brute, adorned<br/>

With gay religions full of pomp and gold,<br/>

And devils to adore for deities:<br/>

Then were they known to men by various names,<br/>

And various idols through the heathen world.<br/>

  Say, Muse, their names then known, who first, who last,<br/>

Roused from the slumber on that fiery couch,<br/>

At their great Emperor's call, as next in worth<br/>

Came singly where he stood on the bare strand,<br/>

While the promiscuous crowd stood yet aloof?<br/>

  The chief were those who, from the pit of Hell<br/>

Roaming to seek their prey on Earth, durst fix<br/>

Their seats, long after, next the seat of God,<br/>

Their altars by his altar, gods adored<br/>

Among the nations round, and durst abide<br/>

Jehovah thundering out of Sion, throned<br/>

Between the Cherubim; yea, often placed<br/>

Within his sanctuary itself their shrines,<br/>

Abominations; and with cursed things<br/>

His holy rites and solemn feasts profaned,<br/>

And with their darkness durst affront his light.<br/>

First, Moloch, horrid king, besmeared with blood<br/>

Of human sacrifice, and parents' tears;<br/>

Though, for the noise of drums and timbrels loud,<br/>

Their children's cries unheard that passed through fire<br/>

To his grim idol.  Him the Ammonite<br/>

Worshiped in Rabba and her watery plain,<br/>

In Argob and in Basan, to the stream<br/>

Of utmost Arnon.  Nor content with such<br/>

Audacious neighbourhood, the wisest heart<br/>

Of Solomon he led by fraud to build<br/>

His temple right against the temple of God<br/>

On that opprobrious hill, and made his grove<br/>

The pleasant valley of Hinnom, Tophet thence<br/>

And black Gehenna called, the type of Hell.<br/>

Next Chemos, th' obscene dread of Moab's sons,<br/>

From Aroar to Nebo and the wild<br/>

Of southmost Abarim; in Hesebon<br/>

And Horonaim, Seon's real, beyond<br/>

The flowery dale of Sibma clad with vines,<br/>

And Eleale to th' Asphaltic Pool:<br/>

Peor his other name, when he enticed<br/>

Israel in Sittim, on their march from Nile,<br/>

To do him wanton rites, which cost them woe.<br/>

Yet thence his lustful orgies he enlarged<br/>

Even to that hill of scandal, by the grove<br/>

Of Moloch homicide, lust hard by hate,<br/>

Till good Josiah drove them thence to Hell.<br/>

With these came they who, from the bordering flood<br/>

Of old Euphrates to the brook that parts<br/>

Egypt from Syrian ground, had general names<br/>

Of Baalim and Ashtaroth—those male,<br/>

These feminine.  For Spirits, when they please,<br/>

Can either sex assume, or both; so soft<br/>

And uncompounded is their essence pure,<br/>

Not tried or manacled with joint or limb,<br/>

Nor founded on the brittle strength of bones,<br/>

Like cumbrous flesh; but, in what shape they choose,<br/>

Dilated or condensed, bright or obscure,<br/>

Can execute their airy purposes,<br/>

And works of love or enmity fulfil.<br/>

For those the race of Israel oft forsook<br/>

Their Living Strength, and unfrequented left<br/>

His righteous altar, bowing lowly down<br/>

To bestial gods; for which their heads as low<br/>

Bowed down in battle, sunk before the spear<br/>

Of despicable foes.  With these in troop<br/>

Came Astoreth, whom the Phoenicians called<br/>

Astarte, queen of heaven, with crescent horns;<br/>

To whose bright image nightly by the moon<br/>

Sidonian virgins paid their vows and songs;<br/>

In Sion also not unsung, where stood<br/>

Her temple on th' offensive mountain, built<br/>

By that uxorious king whose heart, though large,<br/>

Beguiled by fair idolatresses, fell<br/>

To idols foul.  Thammuz came next behind,<br/>

Whose annual wound in Lebanon allured<br/>

The Syrian damsels to lament his fate<br/>

In amorous ditties all a summer's day,<br/>

While smooth Adonis from his native rock<br/>

Ran purple to the sea, supposed with blood<br/>

Of Thammuz yearly wounded: the love-tale<br/>

Infected Sion's daughters with like heat,<br/>

Whose wanton passions in the sacred porch<br/>

Ezekiel saw, when, by the vision led,<br/>

His eye surveyed the dark idolatries<br/>

Of alienated Judah.  Next came one<br/>

Who mourned in earnest, when the captive ark<br/>

Maimed his brute image, head and hands lopt off,<br/>

In his own temple, on the grunsel-edge,<br/>

Where he fell flat and shamed his worshippers:<br/>

Dagon his name, sea-monster, upward man<br/>

And downward fish; yet had his temple high<br/>

Reared in Azotus, dreaded through the coast<br/>

Of Palestine, in Gath and Ascalon,<br/>

And Accaron and Gaza's frontier bounds.<br/>

Him followed Rimmon, whose delightful seat<br/>

Was fair Damascus, on the fertile banks<br/>

Of Abbana and Pharphar, lucid streams.<br/>

He also against the house of God was bold:<br/>

A leper once he lost, and gained a king—<br/>

Ahaz, his sottish conqueror, whom he drew<br/>

God's altar to disparage and displace<br/>

For one of Syrian mode, whereon to burn<br/>

His odious offerings, and adore the gods<br/>

Whom he had vanquished.  After these appeared<br/>

A crew who, under names of old renown—<br/>

Osiris, Isis, Orus, and their train—<br/>

With monstrous shapes and sorceries abused<br/>

Fanatic Egypt and her priests to seek<br/>

Their wandering gods disguised in brutish forms<br/>

Rather than human.  Nor did Israel scape<br/>

Th' infection, when their borrowed gold composed<br/>

The calf in Oreb; and the rebel king<br/>

Doubled that sin in Bethel and in Dan,<br/>

Likening his Maker to the grazed ox—<br/>

Jehovah, who, in one night, when he passed<br/>

From Egypt marching, equalled with one stroke<br/>

Both her first-born and all her bleating gods.<br/>

Belial came last; than whom a Spirit more lewd<br/>

Fell not from Heaven, or more gross to love<br/>

Vice for itself.  To him no temple stood<br/>

Or altar smoked; yet who more oft than he<br/>

In temples and at altars, when the priest<br/>

Turns atheist, as did Eli's sons, who filled<br/>

With lust and violence the house of God?<br/>

In courts and palaces he also reigns,<br/>

And in luxurious cities, where the noise<br/>

Of riot ascends above their loftiest towers,<br/>

And injury and outrage; and, when night<br/>

Darkens the streets, then wander forth the sons<br/>

Of Belial, flown with insolence and wine.<br/>

Witness the streets of Sodom, and that night<br/>

In Gibeah, when the hospitable door<br/>

Exposed a matron, to avoid worse rape.<br/>

  These were the prime in order and in might:<br/>

The rest were long to tell; though far renowned<br/>

Th' Ionian gods—of Javan's issue held<br/>

Gods, yet confessed later than Heaven and Earth,<br/>

Their boasted parents;—Titan, Heaven's first-born,<br/>

With his enormous brood, and birthright seized<br/>

By younger Saturn: he from mightier Jove,<br/>

His own and Rhea's son, like measure found;<br/>

So Jove usurping reigned.  These, first in Crete<br/>

And Ida known, thence on the snowy top<br/>

Of cold Olympus ruled the middle air,<br/>

Their highest heaven; or on the Delphian cliff,<br/>

Or in Dodona, and through all the bounds<br/>

Of Doric land; or who with Saturn old<br/>

Fled over Adria to th' Hesperian fields,<br/>

And o'er the Celtic roamed the utmost Isles.<br/>

  All these and more came flocking; but with looks<br/>

Downcast and damp; yet such wherein appeared<br/>

Obscure some glimpse of joy to have found their Chief<br/>

Not in despair, to have found themselves not lost<br/>

In loss itself; which on his countenance cast<br/>

Like doubtful hue.  But he, his wonted pride<br/>

Soon recollecting, with high words, that bore<br/>

Semblance of worth, not substance, gently raised<br/>

Their fainting courage, and dispelled their fears.<br/>

Then straight commands that, at the warlike sound<br/>

Of trumpets loud and clarions, be upreared<br/>

His mighty standard.  That proud honour claimed<br/>

Azazel as his right, a Cherub tall:<br/>

Who forthwith from the glittering staff unfurled<br/>

Th' imperial ensign; which, full high advanced,<br/>

Shone like a meteor streaming to the wind,<br/>

With gems and golden lustre rich emblazed,<br/>

Seraphic arms and trophies; all the while<br/>

Sonorous metal blowing martial sounds:<br/>

At which the universal host up-sent<br/>

A shout that tore Hell's concave, and beyond<br/>

Frighted the reign of Chaos and old Night.<br/>

All in a moment through the gloom were seen<br/>

Ten thousand banners rise into the air,<br/>

With orient colours waving: with them rose<br/>

A forest huge of spears; and thronging helms<br/>

Appeared, and serried shields in thick array<br/>

Of depth immeasurable.  Anon they move<br/>

In perfect phalanx to the Dorian mood<br/>

Of flutes and soft recorders—such as raised<br/>

To height of noblest temper heroes old<br/>

Arming to battle, and instead of rage<br/>

Deliberate valour breathed, firm, and unmoved<br/>

With dread of death to flight or foul retreat;<br/>

Nor wanting power to mitigate and swage<br/>

With solemn touches troubled thoughts, and chase<br/>

Anguish and doubt and fear and sorrow and pain<br/>

From mortal or immortal minds.  Thus they,<br/>

Breathing united force with fixed thought,<br/>

Moved on in silence to soft pipes that charmed<br/>

Their painful steps o'er the burnt soil.  And now<br/>

Advanced in view they stand—a horrid front<br/>

Of dreadful length and dazzling arms, in guise<br/>

Of warriors old, with ordered spear and shield,<br/>

Awaiting what command their mighty Chief<br/>

Had to impose.  He through the armed files<br/>

Darts his experienced eye, and soon traverse<br/>

The whole battalion views—their order due,<br/>

Their visages and stature as of gods;<br/>

Their number last he sums.  And now his heart<br/>

Distends with pride, and, hardening in his strength,<br/>

Glories: for never, since created Man,<br/>

Met such embodied force as, named with these,<br/>

Could merit more than that small infantry<br/>

Warred on by cranes—though all the giant brood<br/>

Of Phlegra with th' heroic race were joined<br/>

That fought at Thebes and Ilium, on each side<br/>

Mixed with auxiliar gods; and what resounds<br/>

In fable or romance of Uther's son,<br/>

Begirt with British and Armoric knights;<br/>

And all who since, baptized or infidel,<br/>

Jousted in Aspramont, or Montalban,<br/>

Damasco, or Marocco, or Trebisond,<br/>

Or whom Biserta sent from Afric shore<br/>

When Charlemain with all his peerage fell<br/>

By Fontarabbia.  Thus far these beyond<br/>

Compare of mortal prowess, yet observed<br/>

Their dread Commander.  He, above the rest<br/>

In shape and gesture proudly eminent,<br/>

Stood like a tower.  His form had yet not lost<br/>

All her original brightness, nor appeared<br/>

Less than Archangel ruined, and th' excess<br/>

Of glory obscured: as when the sun new-risen<br/>

Looks through the horizontal misty air<br/>

Shorn of his beams, or, from behind the moon,<br/>

In dim eclipse, disastrous twilight sheds<br/>

On half the nations, and with fear of change<br/>

Perplexes monarchs.  Darkened so, yet shone<br/>

Above them all th' Archangel: but his face<br/>

Deep scars of thunder had intrenched, and care<br/>

Sat on his faded cheek, but under brows<br/>

Of dauntless courage, and considerate pride<br/>

Waiting revenge.  Cruel his eye, but cast<br/>

Signs of remorse and passion, to behold<br/>

The fellows of his crime, the followers rather<br/>

(Far other once beheld in bliss), condemned<br/>

For ever now to have their lot in pain—<br/>

Millions of Spirits for his fault amerced<br/>

Of Heaven, and from eternal splendours flung<br/>

For his revolt—yet faithful how they stood,<br/>

Their glory withered; as, when heaven's fire<br/>

Hath scathed the forest oaks or mountain pines,<br/>

With singed top their stately growth, though bare,<br/>

Stands on the blasted heath.  He now prepared<br/>

To speak; whereat their doubled ranks they bend<br/>

From wing to wing, and half enclose him round<br/>

With all his peers: attention held them mute.<br/>

Thrice he assayed, and thrice, in spite of scorn,<br/>

Tears, such as Angels weep, burst forth: at last<br/>

Words interwove with sighs found out their way:—<br/>

  "O myriads of immortal Spirits! O Powers<br/>

Matchless, but with th' Almighty!—and that strife<br/>

Was not inglorious, though th' event was dire,<br/>

As this place testifies, and this dire change,<br/>

Hateful to utter.  But what power of mind,<br/>

Forseeing or presaging, from the depth<br/>

Of knowledge past or present, could have feared<br/>

How such united force of gods, how such<br/>

As stood like these, could ever know repulse?<br/>

For who can yet believe, though after loss,<br/>

That all these puissant legions, whose exile<br/>

Hath emptied Heaven, shall fail to re-ascend,<br/>

Self-raised, and repossess their native seat?<br/>

For me, be witness all the host of Heaven,<br/>

If counsels different, or danger shunned<br/>

By me, have lost our hopes.  But he who reigns<br/>

Monarch in Heaven till then as one secure<br/>

Sat on his throne, upheld by old repute,<br/>

Consent or custom, and his regal state<br/>

Put forth at full, but still his strength concealed—<br/>

Which tempted our attempt, and wrought our fall.<br/>

Henceforth his might we know, and know our own,<br/>

So as not either to provoke, or dread<br/>

New war provoked: our better part remains<br/>

To work in close design, by fraud or guile,<br/>

What force effected not; that he no less<br/>

At length from us may find, who overcomes<br/>

By force hath overcome but half his foe.<br/>

Space may produce new Worlds; whereof so rife<br/>

There went a fame in Heaven that he ere long<br/>

Intended to create, and therein plant<br/>

A generation whom his choice regard<br/>

Should favour equal to the Sons of Heaven.<br/>

Thither, if but to pry, shall be perhaps<br/>

Our first eruption—thither, or elsewhere;<br/>

For this infernal pit shall never hold<br/>

Celestial Spirits in bondage, nor th' Abyss<br/>

Long under darkness cover.  But these thoughts<br/>

Full counsel must mature.  Peace is despaired;<br/>

For who can think submission? War, then, war<br/>

Open or understood, must be resolved."<br/>

  He spake; and, to confirm his words, outflew<br/>

Millions of flaming swords, drawn from the thighs<br/>

Of mighty Cherubim; the sudden blaze<br/>

Far round illumined Hell.  Highly they raged<br/>

Against the Highest, and fierce with grasped arms<br/>

Clashed on their sounding shields the din of war,<br/>

Hurling defiance toward the vault of Heaven.<br/>

  There stood a hill not far, whose grisly top<br/>

Belched fire and rolling smoke; the rest entire<br/>

Shone with a glossy scurf—undoubted sign<br/>

That in his womb was hid metallic ore,<br/>

The work of sulphur.  Thither, winged with speed,<br/>

A numerous brigade hastened: as when bands<br/>

Of pioneers, with spade and pickaxe armed,<br/>

Forerun the royal camp, to trench a field,<br/>

Or cast a rampart.  Mammon led them on—<br/>

Mammon, the least erected Spirit that fell<br/>

From Heaven; for even in Heaven his looks and thoughts<br/>

Were always downward bent, admiring more<br/>

The riches of heaven's pavement, trodden gold,<br/>

Than aught divine or holy else enjoyed<br/>

In vision beatific.  By him first<br/>

Men also, and by his suggestion taught,<br/>

Ransacked the centre, and with impious hands<br/>

Rifled the bowels of their mother Earth<br/>

For treasures better hid.  Soon had his crew<br/>

Opened into the hill a spacious wound,<br/>

And digged out ribs of gold.  Let none admire<br/>

That riches grow in Hell; that soil may best<br/>

Deserve the precious bane.  And here let those<br/>

Who boast in mortal things, and wondering tell<br/>

Of Babel, and the works of Memphian kings,<br/>

Learn how their greatest monuments of fame<br/>

And strength, and art, are easily outdone<br/>

By Spirits reprobate, and in an hour<br/>

What in an age they, with incessant toil<br/>

And hands innumerable, scarce perform.<br/>

Nigh on the plain, in many cells prepared,<br/>

That underneath had veins of liquid fire<br/>

Sluiced from the lake, a second multitude<br/>

With wondrous art founded the massy ore,<br/>

Severing each kind, and scummed the bullion-dross.<br/>

A third as soon had formed within the ground<br/>

A various mould, and from the boiling cells<br/>

By strange conveyance filled each hollow nook;<br/>

As in an organ, from one blast of wind,<br/>

To many a row of pipes the sound-board breathes.<br/>

Anon out of the earth a fabric huge<br/>

Rose like an exhalation, with the sound<br/>

Of dulcet symphonies and voices sweet—<br/>

Built like a temple, where pilasters round<br/>

Were set, and Doric pillars overlaid<br/>

With golden architrave; nor did there want<br/>

Cornice or frieze, with bossy sculptures graven;<br/>

The roof was fretted gold.  Not Babylon<br/>

Nor great Alcairo such magnificence<br/>

Equalled in all their glories, to enshrine<br/>

Belus or Serapis their gods, or seat<br/>

Their kings, when Egypt with Assyria strove<br/>

In wealth and luxury.  Th' ascending pile<br/>

Stood fixed her stately height, and straight the doors,<br/>

Opening their brazen folds, discover, wide<br/>

Within, her ample spaces o'er the smooth<br/>

And level pavement: from the arched roof,<br/>

Pendent by subtle magic, many a row<br/>

Of starry lamps and blazing cressets, fed<br/>

With naptha and asphaltus, yielded light<br/>

As from a sky.  The hasty multitude<br/>

Admiring entered; and the work some praise,<br/>

And some the architect.  His hand was known<br/>

In Heaven by many a towered structure high,<br/>

Where sceptred Angels held their residence,<br/>

And sat as Princes, whom the supreme King<br/>

Exalted to such power, and gave to rule,<br/>

Each in his Hierarchy, the Orders bright.<br/>

Nor was his name unheard or unadored<br/>

In ancient Greece; and in Ausonian land<br/>

Men called him Mulciber; and how he fell<br/>

From Heaven they fabled, thrown by angry Jove<br/>

Sheer o'er the crystal battlements: from morn<br/>

To noon he fell, from noon to dewy eve,<br/>

A summer's day, and with the setting sun<br/>

Dropt from the zenith, like a falling star,<br/>

On Lemnos, th' Aegaean isle.  Thus they relate,<br/>

Erring; for he with this rebellious rout<br/>

Fell long before; nor aught availed him now<br/>

To have built in Heaven high towers; nor did he scape<br/>

By all his engines, but was headlong sent,<br/>

With his industrious crew, to build in Hell.<br/>

  Meanwhile the winged Heralds, by command<br/>

Of sovereign power, with awful ceremony<br/>

And trumpet's sound, throughout the host proclaim<br/>

A solemn council forthwith to be held<br/>

At Pandemonium, the high capital<br/>

Of Satan and his peers.  Their summons called<br/>

From every band and squared regiment<br/>

By place or choice the worthiest: they anon<br/>

With hundreds and with thousands trooping came<br/>

Attended.  All access was thronged; the gates<br/>

And porches wide, but chief the spacious hall<br/>

(Though like a covered field, where champions bold<br/>

Wont ride in armed, and at the Soldan's chair<br/>

Defied the best of Paynim chivalry<br/>

To mortal combat, or career with lance),<br/>

Thick swarmed, both on the ground and in the air,<br/>

Brushed with the hiss of rustling wings.  As bees<br/>

In spring-time, when the Sun with Taurus rides.<br/>

Pour forth their populous youth about the hive<br/>

In clusters; they among fresh dews and flowers<br/>

Fly to and fro, or on the smoothed plank,<br/>

The suburb of their straw-built citadel,<br/>

New rubbed with balm, expatiate, and confer<br/>

Their state-affairs: so thick the airy crowd<br/>

Swarmed and were straitened; till, the signal given,<br/>

Behold a wonder! They but now who seemed<br/>

In bigness to surpass Earth's giant sons,<br/>

Now less than smallest dwarfs, in narrow room<br/>

Throng numberless—like that pygmean race<br/>

Beyond the Indian mount; or faery elves,<br/>

Whose midnight revels, by a forest-side<br/>

Or fountain, some belated peasant sees,<br/>

Or dreams he sees, while overhead the Moon<br/>

Sits arbitress, and nearer to the Earth<br/>

Wheels her pale course: they, on their mirth and dance<br/>

Intent, with jocund music charm his ear;<br/>

At once with joy and fear his heart rebounds.<br/>

Thus incorporeal Spirits to smallest forms<br/>

Reduced their shapes immense, and were at large,<br/>

Though without number still, amidst the hall<br/>

Of that infernal court.  But far within,<br/>

And in their own dimensions like themselves,<br/>

The great Seraphic Lords and Cherubim<br/>

In close recess and secret conclave sat,<br/>

A thousand demi-gods on golden seats,<br/>

Frequent and full.  After short silence then,<br/>

And summons read, the great consult began.<br/>
</p>
<h3 id="id00018" style="margin-top: 3em">Book II</h3>
<p id="id00019" style="margin-top: 2em">High on a throne of royal state, which far<br/>

Outshone the wealth of Ormus and of Ind,<br/>

Or where the gorgeous East with richest hand<br/>

Showers on her kings barbaric pearl and gold,<br/>

Satan exalted sat, by merit raised<br/>

To that bad eminence; and, from despair<br/>

Thus high uplifted beyond hope, aspires<br/>

Beyond thus high, insatiate to pursue<br/>

Vain war with Heaven; and, by success untaught,<br/>

His proud imaginations thus displayed:—<br/>

  "Powers and Dominions, Deities of Heaven!—<br/>

For, since no deep within her gulf can hold<br/>

Immortal vigour, though oppressed and fallen,<br/>

I give not Heaven for lost: from this descent<br/>

Celestial Virtues rising will appear<br/>

More glorious and more dread than from no fall,<br/>

And trust themselves to fear no second fate!—<br/>

Me though just right, and the fixed laws of Heaven,<br/>

Did first create your leader—next, free choice<br/>

With what besides in council or in fight<br/>

Hath been achieved of merit—yet this loss,<br/>

Thus far at least recovered, hath much more<br/>

Established in a safe, unenvied throne,<br/>

Yielded with full consent.  The happier state<br/>

In Heaven, which follows dignity, might draw<br/>

Envy from each inferior; but who here<br/>

Will envy whom the highest place exposes<br/>

Foremost to stand against the Thunderer's aim<br/>

Your bulwark, and condemns to greatest share<br/>

Of endless pain? Where there is, then, no good<br/>

For which to strive, no strife can grow up there<br/>

From faction: for none sure will claim in Hell<br/>

Precedence; none whose portion is so small<br/>

Of present pain that with ambitious mind<br/>

Will covet more! With this advantage, then,<br/>

To union, and firm faith, and firm accord,<br/>

More than can be in Heaven, we now return<br/>

To claim our just inheritance of old,<br/>

Surer to prosper than prosperity<br/>

Could have assured us; and by what best way,<br/>

Whether of open war or covert guile,<br/>

We now debate.  Who can advise may speak."<br/>

  He ceased; and next him Moloch, sceptred king,<br/>

Stood up—the strongest and the fiercest Spirit<br/>

That fought in Heaven, now fiercer by despair.<br/>

His trust was with th' Eternal to be deemed<br/>

Equal in strength, and rather than be less<br/>

Cared not to be at all; with that care lost<br/>

Went all his fear: of God, or Hell, or worse,<br/>

He recked not, and these words thereafter spake:—<br/>

  "My sentence is for open war.  Of wiles,<br/>

More unexpert, I boast not: them let those<br/>

Contrive who need, or when they need; not now.<br/>

For, while they sit contriving, shall the rest—<br/>

Millions that stand in arms, and longing wait<br/>

The signal to ascend—sit lingering here,<br/>

Heaven's fugitives, and for their dwelling-place<br/>

Accept this dark opprobrious den of shame,<br/>

The prison of his tyranny who reigns<br/>

By our delay? No! let us rather choose,<br/>

Armed with Hell-flames and fury, all at once<br/>

O'er Heaven's high towers to force resistless way,<br/>

Turning our tortures into horrid arms<br/>

Against the Torturer; when, to meet the noise<br/>

Of his almighty engine, he shall hear<br/>

Infernal thunder, and, for lightning, see<br/>

Black fire and horror shot with equal rage<br/>

Among his Angels, and his throne itself<br/>

Mixed with Tartarean sulphur and strange fire,<br/>

His own invented torments.  But perhaps<br/>

The way seems difficult, and steep to scale<br/>

With upright wing against a higher foe!<br/>

Let such bethink them, if the sleepy drench<br/>

Of that forgetful lake benumb not still,<br/>

That in our proper motion we ascend<br/>

Up to our native seat; descent and fall<br/>

To us is adverse.  Who but felt of late,<br/>

When the fierce foe hung on our broken rear<br/>

Insulting, and pursued us through the Deep,<br/>

With what compulsion and laborious flight<br/>

We sunk thus low? Th' ascent is easy, then;<br/>

Th' event is feared! Should we again provoke<br/>

Our stronger, some worse way his wrath may find<br/>

To our destruction, if there be in Hell<br/>

Fear to be worse destroyed! What can be worse<br/>

Than to dwell here, driven out from bliss, condemned<br/>

In this abhorred deep to utter woe!<br/>

Where pain of unextinguishable fire<br/>

Must exercise us without hope of end<br/>

The vassals of his anger, when the scourge<br/>

Inexorably, and the torturing hour,<br/>

Calls us to penance? More destroyed than thus,<br/>

We should be quite abolished, and expire.<br/>

What fear we then? what doubt we to incense<br/>

His utmost ire? which, to the height enraged,<br/>

Will either quite consume us, and reduce<br/>

To nothing this essential—happier far<br/>

Than miserable to have eternal being!—<br/>

Or, if our substance be indeed divine,<br/>

And cannot cease to be, we are at worst<br/>

On this side nothing; and by proof we feel<br/>

Our power sufficient to disturb his Heaven,<br/>

And with perpetual inroads to alarm,<br/>

Though inaccessible, his fatal throne:<br/>

Which, if not victory, is yet revenge."<br/>

  He ended frowning, and his look denounced<br/>

Desperate revenge, and battle dangerous<br/>

To less than gods.  On th' other side up rose<br/>

Belial, in act more graceful and humane.<br/>

A fairer person lost not Heaven; he seemed<br/>

For dignity composed, and high exploit.<br/>

But all was false and hollow; though his tongue<br/>

Dropped manna, and could make the worse appear<br/>

The better reason, to perplex and dash<br/>

Maturest counsels: for his thoughts were low—<br/>

To vice industrious, but to nobler deeds<br/>

Timorous and slothful.  Yet he pleased the ear,<br/>

And with persuasive accent thus began:—<br/>

  "I should be much for open war, O Peers,<br/>

As not behind in hate, if what was urged<br/>

Main reason to persuade immediate war<br/>

Did not dissuade me most, and seem to cast<br/>

Ominous conjecture on the whole success;<br/>

When he who most excels in fact of arms,<br/>

In what he counsels and in what excels<br/>

Mistrustful, grounds his courage on despair<br/>

And utter dissolution, as the scope<br/>

Of all his aim, after some dire revenge.<br/>

First, what revenge? The towers of Heaven are filled<br/>

With armed watch, that render all access<br/>

Impregnable: oft on the bordering Deep<br/>

Encamp their legions, or with obscure wing<br/>

Scout far and wide into the realm of Night,<br/>

Scorning surprise.  Or, could we break our way<br/>

By force, and at our heels all Hell should rise<br/>

With blackest insurrection to confound<br/>

Heaven's purest light, yet our great Enemy,<br/>

All incorruptible, would on his throne<br/>

Sit unpolluted, and th' ethereal mould,<br/>

Incapable of stain, would soon expel<br/>

Her mischief, and purge off the baser fire,<br/>

Victorious.  Thus repulsed, our final hope<br/>

Is flat despair: we must exasperate<br/>

Th' Almighty Victor to spend all his rage;<br/>

And that must end us; that must be our cure—<br/>

To be no more.  Sad cure! for who would lose,<br/>

Though full of pain, this intellectual being,<br/>

Those thoughts that wander through eternity,<br/>

To perish rather, swallowed up and lost<br/>

In the wide womb of uncreated Night,<br/>

Devoid of sense and motion? And who knows,<br/>

Let this be good, whether our angry Foe<br/>

Can give it, or will ever? How he can<br/>

Is doubtful; that he never will is sure.<br/>

Will he, so wise, let loose at once his ire,<br/>

Belike through impotence or unaware,<br/>

To give his enemies their wish, and end<br/>

Them in his anger whom his anger saves<br/>

To punish endless? "Wherefore cease we, then?"<br/>

Say they who counsel war; "we are decreed,<br/>

Reserved, and destined to eternal woe;<br/>

Whatever doing, what can we suffer more,<br/>

What can we suffer worse?" Is this, then, worst—<br/>

Thus sitting, thus consulting, thus in arms?<br/>

What when we fled amain, pursued and struck<br/>

With Heaven's afflicting thunder, and besought<br/>

The Deep to shelter us? This Hell then seemed<br/>

A refuge from those wounds.  Or when we lay<br/>

Chained on the burning lake? That sure was worse.<br/>

What if the breath that kindled those grim fires,<br/>

Awaked, should blow them into sevenfold rage,<br/>

And plunge us in the flames; or from above<br/>

Should intermitted vengeance arm again<br/>

His red right hand to plague us? What if all<br/>

Her stores were opened, and this firmament<br/>

Of Hell should spout her cataracts of fire,<br/>

Impendent horrors, threatening hideous fall<br/>

One day upon our heads; while we perhaps,<br/>

Designing or exhorting glorious war,<br/>

Caught in a fiery tempest, shall be hurled,<br/>

Each on his rock transfixed, the sport and prey<br/>

Or racking whirlwinds, or for ever sunk<br/>

Under yon boiling ocean, wrapt in chains,<br/>

There to converse with everlasting groans,<br/>

Unrespited, unpitied, unreprieved,<br/>

Ages of hopeless end? This would be worse.<br/>

War, therefore, open or concealed, alike<br/>

My voice dissuades; for what can force or guile<br/>

With him, or who deceive his mind, whose eye<br/>

Views all things at one view? He from Heaven's height<br/>

All these our motions vain sees and derides,<br/>

Not more almighty to resist our might<br/>

Than wise to frustrate all our plots and wiles.<br/>

Shall we, then, live thus vile—the race of Heaven<br/>

Thus trampled, thus expelled, to suffer here<br/>

Chains and these torments? Better these than worse,<br/>

By my advice; since fate inevitable<br/>

Subdues us, and omnipotent decree,<br/>

The Victor's will.  To suffer, as to do,<br/>

Our strength is equal; nor the law unjust<br/>

That so ordains.  This was at first resolved,<br/>

If we were wise, against so great a foe<br/>

Contending, and so doubtful what might fall.<br/>

I laugh when those who at the spear are bold<br/>

And venturous, if that fail them, shrink, and fear<br/>

What yet they know must follow—to endure<br/>

Exile, or ignominy, or bonds, or pain,<br/>

The sentence of their Conqueror.  This is now<br/>

Our doom; which if we can sustain and bear,<br/>

Our Supreme Foe in time may much remit<br/>

His anger, and perhaps, thus far removed,<br/>

Not mind us not offending, satisfied<br/>

With what is punished; whence these raging fires<br/>

Will slacken, if his breath stir not their flames.<br/>

Our purer essence then will overcome<br/>

Their noxious vapour; or, inured, not feel;<br/>

Or, changed at length, and to the place conformed<br/>

In temper and in nature, will receive<br/>

Familiar the fierce heat; and, void of pain,<br/>

This horror will grow mild, this darkness light;<br/>

Besides what hope the never-ending flight<br/>

Of future days may bring, what chance, what change<br/>

Worth waiting—since our present lot appears<br/>

For happy though but ill, for ill not worst,<br/>

If we procure not to ourselves more woe."<br/>

  Thus Belial, with words clothed in reason's garb,<br/>

Counselled ignoble ease and peaceful sloth,<br/>

Not peace; and after him thus Mammon spake:—<br/>

  "Either to disenthrone the King of Heaven<br/>

We war, if war be best, or to regain<br/>

Our own right lost.  Him to unthrone we then<br/>

May hope, when everlasting Fate shall yield<br/>

To fickle Chance, and Chaos judge the strife.<br/>

The former, vain to hope, argues as vain<br/>

The latter; for what place can be for us<br/>

Within Heaven's bound, unless Heaven's Lord supreme<br/>

We overpower? Suppose he should relent<br/>

And publish grace to all, on promise made<br/>

Of new subjection; with what eyes could we<br/>

Stand in his presence humble, and receive<br/>

Strict laws imposed, to celebrate his throne<br/>

With warbled hymns, and to his Godhead sing<br/>

Forced hallelujahs, while he lordly sits<br/>

Our envied sovereign, and his altar breathes<br/>

Ambrosial odours and ambrosial flowers,<br/>

Our servile offerings? This must be our task<br/>

In Heaven, this our delight.  How wearisome<br/>

Eternity so spent in worship paid<br/>

To whom we hate! Let us not then pursue,<br/>

By force impossible, by leave obtained<br/>

Unacceptable, though in Heaven, our state<br/>

Of splendid vassalage; but rather seek<br/>

Our own good from ourselves, and from our own<br/>

Live to ourselves, though in this vast recess,<br/>

Free and to none accountable, preferring<br/>

Hard liberty before the easy yoke<br/>

Of servile pomp.  Our greatness will appear<br/>

Then most conspicuous when great things of small,<br/>

Useful of hurtful, prosperous of adverse,<br/>

We can create, and in what place soe'er<br/>

Thrive under evil, and work ease out of pain<br/>

Through labour and endurance.  This deep world<br/>

Of darkness do we dread? How oft amidst<br/>

Thick clouds and dark doth Heaven's all-ruling Sire<br/>

Choose to reside, his glory unobscured,<br/>

And with the majesty of darkness round<br/>

Covers his throne, from whence deep thunders roar.<br/>

Mustering their rage, and Heaven resembles Hell!<br/>

As he our darkness, cannot we his light<br/>

Imitate when we please? This desert soil<br/>

Wants not her hidden lustre, gems and gold;<br/>

Nor want we skill or art from whence to raise<br/>

Magnificence; and what can Heaven show more?<br/>

Our torments also may, in length of time,<br/>

Become our elements, these piercing fires<br/>

As soft as now severe, our temper changed<br/>

Into their temper; which must needs remove<br/>

The sensible of pain.  All things invite<br/>

To peaceful counsels, and the settled state<br/>

Of order, how in safety best we may<br/>

Compose our present evils, with regard<br/>

Of what we are and where, dismissing quite<br/>

All thoughts of war.  Ye have what I advise."<br/>

  He scarce had finished, when such murmur filled<br/>

Th' assembly as when hollow rocks retain<br/>

The sound of blustering winds, which all night long<br/>

Had roused the sea, now with hoarse cadence lull<br/>

Seafaring men o'erwatched, whose bark by chance<br/>

Or pinnace, anchors in a craggy bay<br/>

After the tempest.  Such applause was heard<br/>

As Mammon ended, and his sentence pleased,<br/>

Advising peace: for such another field<br/>

They dreaded worse than Hell; so much the fear<br/>

Of thunder and the sword of Michael<br/>

Wrought still within them; and no less desire<br/>

To found this nether empire, which might rise,<br/>

By policy and long process of time,<br/>

In emulation opposite to Heaven.<br/>

Which when Beelzebub perceived—than whom,<br/>

Satan except, none higher sat—with grave<br/>

Aspect he rose, and in his rising seemed<br/>

A pillar of state.  Deep on his front engraven<br/>

Deliberation sat, and public care;<br/>

And princely counsel in his face yet shone,<br/>

Majestic, though in ruin.  Sage he stood<br/>

With Atlantean shoulders, fit to bear<br/>

The weight of mightiest monarchies; his look<br/>

Drew audience and attention still as night<br/>

Or summer's noontide air, while thus he spake:—<br/>

  "Thrones and Imperial Powers, Offspring of Heaven,<br/>

Ethereal Virtues! or these titles now<br/>

Must we renounce, and, changing style, be called<br/>

Princes of Hell? for so the popular vote<br/>

Inclines—here to continue, and build up here<br/>

A growing empire; doubtless! while we dream,<br/>

And know not that the King of Heaven hath doomed<br/>

This place our dungeon, not our safe retreat<br/>

Beyond his potent arm, to live exempt<br/>

From Heaven's high jurisdiction, in new league<br/>

Banded against his throne, but to remain<br/>

In strictest bondage, though thus far removed,<br/>

Under th' inevitable curb, reserved<br/>

His captive multitude.  For he, to be sure,<br/>

In height or depth, still first and last will reign<br/>

Sole king, and of his kingdom lose no part<br/>

By our revolt, but over Hell extend<br/>

His empire, and with iron sceptre rule<br/>

Us here, as with his golden those in Heaven.<br/>

What sit we then projecting peace and war?<br/>

War hath determined us and foiled with loss<br/>

Irreparable; terms of peace yet none<br/>

Vouchsafed or sought; for what peace will be given<br/>

To us enslaved, but custody severe,<br/>

And stripes and arbitrary punishment<br/>

Inflicted? and what peace can we return,<br/>

But, to our power, hostility and hate,<br/>

Untamed reluctance, and revenge, though slow,<br/>

Yet ever plotting how the Conqueror least<br/>

May reap his conquest, and may least rejoice<br/>

In doing what we most in suffering feel?<br/>

Nor will occasion want, nor shall we need<br/>

With dangerous expedition to invade<br/>

Heaven, whose high walls fear no assault or siege,<br/>

Or ambush from the Deep.  What if we find<br/>

Some easier enterprise? There is a place<br/>

(If ancient and prophetic fame in Heaven<br/>

Err not)—another World, the happy seat<br/>

Of some new race, called Man, about this time<br/>

To be created like to us, though less<br/>

In power and excellence, but favoured more<br/>

Of him who rules above; so was his will<br/>

Pronounced among the Gods, and by an oath<br/>

That shook Heaven's whole circumference confirmed.<br/>

Thither let us bend all our thoughts, to learn<br/>

What creatures there inhabit, of what mould<br/>

Or substance, how endued, and what their power<br/>

And where their weakness: how attempted best,<br/>

By force of subtlety.  Though Heaven be shut,<br/>

And Heaven's high Arbitrator sit secure<br/>

In his own strength, this place may lie exposed,<br/>

The utmost border of his kingdom, left<br/>

To their defence who hold it: here, perhaps,<br/>

Some advantageous act may be achieved<br/>

By sudden onset—either with Hell-fire<br/>

To waste his whole creation, or possess<br/>

All as our own, and drive, as we were driven,<br/>

The puny habitants; or, if not drive,<br/>

Seduce them to our party, that their God<br/>

May prove their foe, and with repenting hand<br/>

Abolish his own works.  This would surpass<br/>

Common revenge, and interrupt his joy<br/>

In our confusion, and our joy upraise<br/>

In his disturbance; when his darling sons,<br/>

Hurled headlong to partake with us, shall curse<br/>

Their frail original, and faded bliss—<br/>

Faded so soon! Advise if this be worth<br/>

Attempting, or to sit in darkness here<br/>

Hatching vain empires." Thus Beelzebub<br/>

Pleaded his devilish counsel—first devised<br/>

By Satan, and in part proposed: for whence,<br/>

But from the author of all ill, could spring<br/>

So deep a malice, to confound the race<br/>

Of mankind in one root, and Earth with Hell<br/>

To mingle and involve, done all to spite<br/>

The great Creator? But their spite still serves<br/>

His glory to augment.  The bold design<br/>

Pleased highly those infernal States, and joy<br/>

Sparkled in all their eyes: with full assent<br/>

They vote: whereat his speech he thus renews:—<br/>

"Well have ye judged, well ended long debate,<br/>

Synod of Gods, and, like to what ye are,<br/>

Great things resolved, which from the lowest deep<br/>

Will once more lift us up, in spite of fate,<br/>

Nearer our ancient seat—perhaps in view<br/>

Of those bright confines, whence, with neighbouring arms,<br/>

And opportune excursion, we may chance<br/>

Re-enter Heaven; or else in some mild zone<br/>

Dwell, not unvisited of Heaven's fair light,<br/>

Secure, and at the brightening orient beam<br/>

Purge off this gloom: the soft delicious air,<br/>

To heal the scar of these corrosive fires,<br/>

Shall breathe her balm.  But, first, whom shall we send<br/>

In search of this new World? whom shall we find<br/>

Sufficient? who shall tempt with wandering feet<br/>

The dark, unbottomed, infinite Abyss,<br/>

And through the palpable obscure find out<br/>

His uncouth way, or spread his airy flight,<br/>

Upborne with indefatigable wings<br/>

Over the vast abrupt, ere he arrive<br/>

The happy Isle? What strength, what art, can then<br/>

Suffice, or what evasion bear him safe,<br/>

Through the strict senteries and stations thick<br/>

Of Angels watching round? Here he had need<br/>

All circumspection: and we now no less<br/>

Choice in our suffrage; for on whom we send<br/>

The weight of all, and our last hope, relies."<br/>

  This said, he sat; and expectation held<br/>

His look suspense, awaiting who appeared<br/>

To second, or oppose, or undertake<br/>

The perilous attempt.  But all sat mute,<br/>

Pondering the danger with deep thoughts; and each<br/>

In other's countenance read his own dismay,<br/>

Astonished.  None among the choice and prime<br/>

Of those Heaven-warring champions could be found<br/>

So hardy as to proffer or accept,<br/>

Alone, the dreadful voyage; till, at last,<br/>

Satan, whom now transcendent glory raised<br/>

Above his fellows, with monarchal pride<br/>

Conscious of highest worth, unmoved thus spake:—<br/>

  "O Progeny of Heaven! Empyreal Thrones!<br/>

With reason hath deep silence and demur<br/>

Seized us, though undismayed.  Long is the way<br/>

And hard, that out of Hell leads up to light.<br/>

Our prison strong, this huge convex of fire,<br/>

Outrageous to devour, immures us round<br/>

Ninefold; and gates of burning adamant,<br/>

Barred over us, prohibit all egress.<br/>

These passed, if any pass, the void profound<br/>

Of unessential Night receives him next,<br/>

Wide-gaping, and with utter loss of being<br/>

Threatens him, plunged in that abortive gulf.<br/>

If thence he scape, into whatever world,<br/>

Or unknown region, what remains him less<br/>

Than unknown dangers, and as hard escape?<br/>

But I should ill become this throne, O Peers,<br/>

And this imperial sovereignty, adorned<br/>

With splendour, armed with power, if aught proposed<br/>

And judged of public moment in the shape<br/>

Of difficulty or danger, could deter<br/>

Me from attempting.  Wherefore do I assume<br/>

These royalties, and not refuse to reign,<br/>

Refusing to accept as great a share<br/>

Of hazard as of honour, due alike<br/>

To him who reigns, and so much to him due<br/>

Of hazard more as he above the rest<br/>

High honoured sits? Go, therefore, mighty Powers,<br/>

Terror of Heaven, though fallen; intend at home,<br/>

While here shall be our home, what best may ease<br/>

The present misery, and render Hell<br/>

More tolerable; if there be cure or charm<br/>

To respite, or deceive, or slack the pain<br/>

Of this ill mansion: intermit no watch<br/>

Against a wakeful foe, while I abroad<br/>

Through all the coasts of dark destruction seek<br/>

Deliverance for us all.  This enterprise<br/>

None shall partake with me." Thus saying, rose<br/>

The Monarch, and prevented all reply;<br/>

Prudent lest, from his resolution raised,<br/>

Others among the chief might offer now,<br/>

Certain to be refused, what erst they feared,<br/>

And, so refused, might in opinion stand<br/>

His rivals, winning cheap the high repute<br/>

Which he through hazard huge must earn.  But they<br/>

Dreaded not more th' adventure than his voice<br/>

Forbidding; and at once with him they rose.<br/>

Their rising all at once was as the sound<br/>

Of thunder heard remote.  Towards him they bend<br/>

With awful reverence prone, and as a God<br/>

Extol him equal to the Highest in Heaven.<br/>

Nor failed they to express how much they praised<br/>

That for the general safety he despised<br/>

His own: for neither do the Spirits damned<br/>

Lose all their virtue; lest bad men should boast<br/>

Their specious deeds on earth, which glory excites,<br/>

Or close ambition varnished o'er with zeal.<br/>

  Thus they their doubtful consultations dark<br/>

Ended, rejoicing in their matchless Chief:<br/>

As, when from mountain-tops the dusky clouds<br/>

Ascending, while the north wind sleeps, o'erspread<br/>

Heaven's cheerful face, the louring element<br/>

Scowls o'er the darkened landscape snow or shower,<br/>

If chance the radiant sun, with farewell sweet,<br/>

Extend his evening beam, the fields revive,<br/>

The birds their notes renew, and bleating herds<br/>

Attest their joy, that hill and valley rings.<br/>

O shame to men! Devil with devil damned<br/>

Firm concord holds; men only disagree<br/>

Of creatures rational, though under hope<br/>

Of heavenly grace, and, God proclaiming peace,<br/>

Yet live in hatred, enmity, and strife<br/>

Among themselves, and levy cruel wars<br/>

Wasting the earth, each other to destroy:<br/>

As if (which might induce us to accord)<br/>

Man had not hellish foes enow besides,<br/>

That day and night for his destruction wait!<br/>

  The Stygian council thus dissolved; and forth<br/>

In order came the grand infernal Peers:<br/>

Midst came their mighty Paramount, and seemed<br/>

Alone th' antagonist of Heaven, nor less<br/>

Than Hell's dread Emperor, with pomp supreme,<br/>

And god-like imitated state: him round<br/>

A globe of fiery Seraphim enclosed<br/>

With bright emblazonry, and horrent arms.<br/>

Then of their session ended they bid cry<br/>

With trumpet's regal sound the great result:<br/>

Toward the four winds four speedy Cherubim<br/>

Put to their mouths the sounding alchemy,<br/>

By herald's voice explained; the hollow Abyss<br/>

Heard far and wide, and all the host of Hell<br/>

With deafening shout returned them loud acclaim.<br/>

Thence more at ease their minds, and somewhat raised<br/>

By false presumptuous hope, the ranged Powers<br/>

Disband; and, wandering, each his several way<br/>

Pursues, as inclination or sad choice<br/>

Leads him perplexed, where he may likeliest find<br/>

Truce to his restless thoughts, and entertain<br/>

The irksome hours, till his great Chief return.<br/>

Part on the plain, or in the air sublime,<br/>

Upon the wing or in swift race contend,<br/>

As at th' Olympian games or Pythian fields;<br/>

Part curb their fiery steeds, or shun the goal<br/>

With rapid wheels, or fronted brigades form:<br/>

As when, to warn proud cities, war appears<br/>

Waged in the troubled sky, and armies rush<br/>

To battle in the clouds; before each van<br/>

Prick forth the airy knights, and couch their spears,<br/>

Till thickest legions close; with feats of arms<br/>

From either end of heaven the welkin burns.<br/>

Others, with vast Typhoean rage, more fell,<br/>

Rend up both rocks and hills, and ride the air<br/>

In whirlwind; Hell scarce holds the wild uproar:—<br/>

As when Alcides, from Oechalia crowned<br/>

With conquest, felt th' envenomed robe, and tore<br/>

Through pain up by the roots Thessalian pines,<br/>

And Lichas from the top of Oeta threw<br/>

Into th' Euboic sea.  Others, more mild,<br/>

Retreated in a silent valley, sing<br/>

With notes angelical to many a harp<br/>

Their own heroic deeds, and hapless fall<br/>

By doom of battle, and complain that Fate<br/>

Free Virtue should enthrall to Force or Chance.<br/>

Their song was partial; but the harmony<br/>

(What could it less when Spirits immortal sing?)<br/>

Suspended Hell, and took with ravishment<br/>

The thronging audience.  In discourse more sweet<br/>

(For Eloquence the Soul, Song charms the Sense)<br/>

Others apart sat on a hill retired,<br/>

In thoughts more elevate, and reasoned high<br/>

Of Providence, Foreknowledge, Will, and Fate—<br/>

Fixed fate, free will, foreknowledge absolute,<br/>

And found no end, in wandering mazes lost.<br/>

Of good and evil much they argued then,<br/>

Of happiness and final misery,<br/>

Passion and apathy, and glory and shame:<br/>

Vain wisdom all, and false philosophy!—<br/>

Yet, with a pleasing sorcery, could charm<br/>

Pain for a while or anguish, and excite<br/>

Fallacious hope, or arm th' obdured breast<br/>

With stubborn patience as with triple steel.<br/>

Another part, in squadrons and gross bands,<br/>

On bold adventure to discover wide<br/>

That dismal world, if any clime perhaps<br/>

Might yield them easier habitation, bend<br/>

Four ways their flying march, along the banks<br/>

Of four infernal rivers, that disgorge<br/>

Into the burning lake their baleful streams—<br/>

Abhorred Styx, the flood of deadly hate;<br/>

Sad Acheron of sorrow, black and deep;<br/>

Cocytus, named of lamentation loud<br/>

Heard on the rueful stream; fierce Phlegeton,<br/>

Whose waves of torrent fire inflame with rage.<br/>

Far off from these, a slow and silent stream,<br/>

Lethe, the river of oblivion, rolls<br/>

Her watery labyrinth, whereof who drinks<br/>

Forthwith his former state and being forgets—<br/>

Forgets both joy and grief, pleasure and pain.<br/>

Beyond this flood a frozen continent<br/>

Lies dark and wild, beat with perpetual storms<br/>

Of whirlwind and dire hail, which on firm land<br/>

Thaws not, but gathers heap, and ruin seems<br/>

Of ancient pile; all else deep snow and ice,<br/>

A gulf profound as that Serbonian bog<br/>

Betwixt Damiata and Mount Casius old,<br/>

Where armies whole have sunk: the parching air<br/>

Burns frore, and cold performs th' effect of fire.<br/>

Thither, by harpy-footed Furies haled,<br/>

At certain revolutions all the damned<br/>

Are brought; and feel by turns the bitter change<br/>

Of fierce extremes, extremes by change more fierce,<br/>

From beds of raging fire to starve in ice<br/>

Their soft ethereal warmth, and there to pine<br/>

Immovable, infixed, and frozen round<br/>

Periods of time,—thence hurried back to fire.<br/>

They ferry over this Lethean sound<br/>

Both to and fro, their sorrow to augment,<br/>

And wish and struggle, as they pass, to reach<br/>

The tempting stream, with one small drop to lose<br/>

In sweet forgetfulness all pain and woe,<br/>

All in one moment, and so near the brink;<br/>

But Fate withstands, and, to oppose th' attempt,<br/>

Medusa with Gorgonian terror guards<br/>

The ford, and of itself the water flies<br/>

All taste of living wight, as once it fled<br/>

The lip of Tantalus.  Thus roving on<br/>

In confused march forlorn, th' adventurous bands,<br/>

With shuddering horror pale, and eyes aghast,<br/>

Viewed first their lamentable lot, and found<br/>

No rest.  Through many a dark and dreary vale<br/>

They passed, and many a region dolorous,<br/>

O'er many a frozen, many a fiery alp,<br/>

Rocks, caves, lakes, fens, bogs, dens, and shades of death—<br/>

A universe of death, which God by curse<br/>

Created evil, for evil only good;<br/>

Where all life dies, death lives, and Nature breeds,<br/>

Perverse, all monstrous, all prodigious things,<br/>

Obominable, inutterable, and worse<br/>

Than fables yet have feigned or fear conceived,<br/>

Gorgons, and Hydras, and Chimeras dire.<br/>

  Meanwhile the Adversary of God and Man,<br/>

Satan, with thoughts inflamed of highest design,<br/>

Puts on swift wings, and toward the gates of Hell<br/>

Explores his solitary flight: sometimes<br/>

He scours the right hand coast, sometimes the left;<br/>

Now shaves with level wing the deep, then soars<br/>

Up to the fiery concave towering high.<br/>

As when far off at sea a fleet descried<br/>

Hangs in the clouds, by equinoctial winds<br/>

Close sailing from Bengala, or the isles<br/>

Of Ternate and Tidore, whence merchants bring<br/>

Their spicy drugs; they on the trading flood,<br/>

Through the wide Ethiopian to the Cape,<br/>

Ply stemming nightly toward the pole: so seemed<br/>

Far off the flying Fiend.  At last appear<br/>

Hell-bounds, high reaching to the horrid roof,<br/>

And thrice threefold the gates; three folds were brass,<br/>

Three iron, three of adamantine rock,<br/>

Impenetrable, impaled with circling fire,<br/>

Yet unconsumed.  Before the gates there sat<br/>

On either side a formidable Shape.<br/>

The one seemed woman to the waist, and fair,<br/>

But ended foul in many a scaly fold,<br/>

Voluminous and vast—a serpent armed<br/>

With mortal sting.  About her middle round<br/>

A cry of Hell-hounds never-ceasing barked<br/>

With wide Cerberean mouths full loud, and rung<br/>

A hideous peal; yet, when they list, would creep,<br/>

If aught disturbed their noise, into her womb,<br/>

And kennel there; yet there still barked and howled<br/>

Within unseen.  Far less abhorred than these<br/>

Vexed Scylla, bathing in the sea that parts<br/>

Calabria from the hoarse Trinacrian shore;<br/>

Nor uglier follow the night-hag, when, called<br/>

In secret, riding through the air she comes,<br/>

Lured with the smell of infant blood, to dance<br/>

With Lapland witches, while the labouring moon<br/>

Eclipses at their charms.  The other Shape—<br/>

If shape it might be called that shape had none<br/>

Distinguishable in member, joint, or limb;<br/>

Or substance might be called that shadow seemed,<br/>

For each seemed either—black it stood as Night,<br/>

Fierce as ten Furies, terrible as Hell,<br/>

And shook a dreadful dart: what seemed his head<br/>

The likeness of a kingly crown had on.<br/>

Satan was now at hand, and from his seat<br/>

The monster moving onward came as fast<br/>

With horrid strides; Hell trembled as he strode.<br/>

Th' undaunted Fiend what this might be admired—<br/>

Admired, not feared (God and his Son except,<br/>

Created thing naught valued he nor shunned),<br/>

And with disdainful look thus first began:—<br/>

  "Whence and what art thou, execrable Shape,<br/>

That dar'st, though grim and terrible, advance<br/>

Thy miscreated front athwart my way<br/>

To yonder gates? Through them I mean to pass,<br/>

That be assured, without leave asked of thee.<br/>

Retire; or taste thy folly, and learn by proof,<br/>

Hell-born, not to contend with Spirits of Heaven."<br/>

  To whom the Goblin, full of wrath, replied:—<br/>

"Art thou that traitor Angel? art thou he,<br/>

Who first broke peace in Heaven and faith, till then<br/>

Unbroken, and in proud rebellious arms<br/>

Drew after him the third part of Heaven's sons,<br/>

Conjured against the Highest—for which both thou<br/>

And they, outcast from God, are here condemned<br/>

To waste eternal days in woe and pain?<br/>

And reckon'st thou thyself with Spirits of Heaven<br/>

Hell-doomed, and breath'st defiance here and scorn,<br/>

Where I reign king, and, to enrage thee more,<br/>

Thy king and lord? Back to thy punishment,<br/>

False fugitive; and to thy speed add wings,<br/>

Lest with a whip of scorpions I pursue<br/>

Thy lingering, or with one stroke of this dart<br/>

Strange horror seize thee, and pangs unfelt before."<br/>

  So spake the grisly Terror, and in shape,<br/>

So speaking and so threatening, grew tenfold,<br/>

More dreadful and deform.  On th' other side,<br/>

Incensed with indignation, Satan stood<br/>

Unterrified, and like a comet burned,<br/>

That fires the length of Ophiuchus huge<br/>

In th' arctic sky, and from his horrid hair<br/>

Shakes pestilence and war.  Each at the head<br/>

Levelled his deadly aim; their fatal hands<br/>

No second stroke intend; and such a frown<br/>

Each cast at th' other as when two black clouds,<br/>

With heaven's artillery fraught, came rattling on<br/>

Over the Caspian,—then stand front to front<br/>

Hovering a space, till winds the signal blow<br/>

To join their dark encounter in mid-air.<br/>

So frowned the mighty combatants that Hell<br/>

Grew darker at their frown; so matched they stood;<br/>

For never but once more was wither like<br/>

To meet so great a foe.  And now great deeds<br/>

Had been achieved, whereof all Hell had rung,<br/>

Had not the snaky Sorceress, that sat<br/>

Fast by Hell-gate and kept the fatal key,<br/>

Risen, and with hideous outcry rushed between.<br/>

  "O father, what intends thy hand," she cried,<br/>

"Against thy only son? What fury, O son,<br/>

Possesses thee to bend that mortal dart<br/>

Against thy father's head? And know'st for whom?<br/>

For him who sits above, and laughs the while<br/>

At thee, ordained his drudge to execute<br/>

Whate'er his wrath, which he calls justice, bids—<br/>

His wrath, which one day will destroy ye both!"<br/>

  She spake, and at her words the hellish Pest<br/>

Forbore: then these to her Satan returned:—<br/>

  "So strange thy outcry, and thy words so strange<br/>

Thou interposest, that my sudden hand,<br/>

Prevented, spares to tell thee yet by deeds<br/>

What it intends, till first I know of thee<br/>

What thing thou art, thus double-formed, and why,<br/>

In this infernal vale first met, thou call'st<br/>

Me father, and that phantasm call'st my son.<br/>

I know thee not, nor ever saw till now<br/>

Sight more detestable than him and thee."<br/>

  T' whom thus the Portress of Hell-gate replied:—<br/>

"Hast thou forgot me, then; and do I seem<br/>

Now in thine eye so foul?—once deemed so fair<br/>

In Heaven, when at th' assembly, and in sight<br/>

Of all the Seraphim with thee combined<br/>

In bold conspiracy against Heaven's King,<br/>

All on a sudden miserable pain<br/>

Surprised thee, dim thine eyes and dizzy swum<br/>

In darkness, while thy head flames thick and fast<br/>

Threw forth, till on the left side opening wide,<br/>

Likest to thee in shape and countenance bright,<br/>

Then shining heavenly fair, a goddess armed,<br/>

Out of thy head I sprung.  Amazement seized<br/>

All th' host of Heaven; back they recoiled afraid<br/>

At first, and called me Sin, and for a sign<br/>

Portentous held me; but, familiar grown,<br/>

I pleased, and with attractive graces won<br/>

The most averse—thee chiefly, who, full oft<br/>

Thyself in me thy perfect image viewing,<br/>

Becam'st enamoured; and such joy thou took'st<br/>

With me in secret that my womb conceived<br/>

A growing burden.  Meanwhile war arose,<br/>

And fields were fought in Heaven: wherein remained<br/>

(For what could else?) to our Almighty Foe<br/>

Clear victory; to our part loss and rout<br/>

Through all the Empyrean.  Down they fell,<br/>

Driven headlong from the pitch of Heaven, down<br/>

Into this Deep; and in the general fall<br/>

I also: at which time this powerful key<br/>

Into my hands was given, with charge to keep<br/>

These gates for ever shut, which none can pass<br/>

Without my opening.  Pensive here I sat<br/>

Alone; but long I sat not, till my womb,<br/>

Pregnant by thee, and now excessive grown,<br/>

Prodigious motion felt and rueful throes.<br/>

At last this odious offspring whom thou seest,<br/>

Thine own begotten, breaking violent way,<br/>

Tore through my entrails, that, with fear and pain<br/>

Distorted, all my nether shape thus grew<br/>

Transformed: but he my inbred enemy<br/>

Forth issued, brandishing his fatal dart,<br/>

Made to destroy.  I fled, and cried out Death!<br/>

Hell trembled at the hideous name, and sighed<br/>

From all her caves, and back resounded Death!<br/>

I fled; but he pursued (though more, it seems,<br/>

Inflamed with lust than rage), and, swifter far,<br/>

Me overtook, his mother, all dismayed,<br/>

And, in embraces forcible and foul<br/>

Engendering with me, of that rape begot<br/>

These yelling monsters, that with ceaseless cry<br/>

Surround me, as thou saw'st—hourly conceived<br/>

And hourly born, with sorrow infinite<br/>

To me; for, when they list, into the womb<br/>

That bred them they return, and howl, and gnaw<br/>

My bowels, their repast; then, bursting forth<br/>

Afresh, with conscious terrors vex me round,<br/>

That rest or intermission none I find.<br/>

Before mine eyes in opposition sits<br/>

Grim Death, my son and foe, who set them on,<br/>

And me, his parent, would full soon devour<br/>

For want of other prey, but that he knows<br/>

His end with mine involved, and knows that I<br/>

Should prove a bitter morsel, and his bane,<br/>

Whenever that shall be: so Fate pronounced.<br/>

But thou, O father, I forewarn thee, shun<br/>

His deadly arrow; neither vainly hope<br/>

To be invulnerable in those bright arms,<br/>

Through tempered heavenly; for that mortal dint,<br/>

Save he who reigns above, none can resist."<br/>

  She finished; and the subtle Fiend his lore<br/>

Soon learned, now milder, and thus answered smooth:—<br/>

  "Dear daughter—since thou claim'st me for thy sire,<br/>

And my fair son here show'st me, the dear pledge<br/>

Of dalliance had with thee in Heaven, and joys<br/>

Then sweet, now sad to mention, through dire change<br/>

Befallen us unforeseen, unthought-of—know,<br/>

I come no enemy, but to set free<br/>

From out this dark and dismal house of pain<br/>

Both him and thee, and all the heavenly host<br/>

Of Spirits that, in our just pretences armed,<br/>

Fell with us from on high.  From them I go<br/>

This uncouth errand sole, and one for all<br/>

Myself expose, with lonely steps to tread<br/>

Th' unfounded Deep, and through the void immense<br/>

To search, with wandering quest, a place foretold<br/>

Should be—and, by concurring signs, ere now<br/>

Created vast and round—a place of bliss<br/>

In the purlieus of Heaven; and therein placed<br/>

A race of upstart creatures, to supply<br/>

Perhaps our vacant room, though more removed,<br/>

Lest Heaven, surcharged with potent multitude,<br/>

Might hap to move new broils.  Be this, or aught<br/>

Than this more secret, now designed, I haste<br/>

To know; and, this once known, shall soon return,<br/>

And bring ye to the place where thou and Death<br/>

Shall dwell at ease, and up and down unseen<br/>

Wing silently the buxom air, embalmed<br/>

With odours.  There ye shall be fed and filled<br/>

Immeasurably; all things shall be your prey."<br/>

  He ceased; for both seemed highly pleased, and Death<br/>

Grinned horrible a ghastly smile, to hear<br/>

His famine should be filled, and blessed his maw<br/>

Destined to that good hour.  No less rejoiced<br/>

His mother bad, and thus bespake her sire:—<br/>

  "The key of this infernal Pit, by due<br/>

And by command of Heaven's all-powerful King,<br/>

I keep, by him forbidden to unlock<br/>

These adamantine gates; against all force<br/>

Death ready stands to interpose his dart,<br/>

Fearless to be o'ermatched by living might.<br/>

But what owe I to his commands above,<br/>

Who hates me, and hath hither thrust me down<br/>

Into this gloom of Tartarus profound,<br/>

To sit in hateful office here confined,<br/>

Inhabitant of Heaven and heavenly born—<br/>

Here in perpetual agony and pain,<br/>

With terrors and with clamours compassed round<br/>

Of mine own brood, that on my bowels feed?<br/>

Thou art my father, thou my author, thou<br/>

My being gav'st me; whom should I obey<br/>

But thee? whom follow? Thou wilt bring me soon<br/>

To that new world of light and bliss, among<br/>

The gods who live at ease, where I shall reign<br/>

At thy right hand voluptuous, as beseems<br/>

Thy daughter and thy darling, without end."<br/>

  Thus saying, from her side the fatal key,<br/>

Sad instrument of all our woe, she took;<br/>

And, towards the gate rolling her bestial train,<br/>

Forthwith the huge portcullis high up-drew,<br/>

Which, but herself, not all the Stygian Powers<br/>

Could once have moved; then in the key-hole turns<br/>

Th' intricate wards, and every bolt and bar<br/>

Of massy iron or solid rock with ease<br/>

Unfastens.  On a sudden open fly,<br/>

With impetuous recoil and jarring sound,<br/>

Th' infernal doors, and on their hinges grate<br/>

Harsh thunder, that the lowest bottom shook<br/>

Of Erebus.  She opened; but to shut<br/>

Excelled her power: the gates wide open stood,<br/>

That with extended wings a bannered host,<br/>

Under spread ensigns marching, might pass through<br/>

With horse and chariots ranked in loose array;<br/>

So wide they stood, and like a furnace-mouth<br/>

Cast forth redounding smoke and ruddy flame.<br/>

Before their eyes in sudden view appear<br/>

The secrets of the hoary Deep—a dark<br/>

Illimitable ocean, without bound,<br/>

Without dimension; where length, breadth, and height,<br/>

And time, and place, are lost; where eldest Night<br/>

And Chaos, ancestors of Nature, hold<br/>

Eternal anarchy, amidst the noise<br/>

Of endless wars, and by confusion stand.<br/>

For Hot, Cold, Moist, and Dry, four champions fierce,<br/>

Strive here for mastery, and to battle bring<br/>

Their embryon atoms: they around the flag<br/>

Of each his faction, in their several clans,<br/>

Light-armed or heavy, sharp, smooth, swift, or slow,<br/>

Swarm populous, unnumbered as the sands<br/>

Of Barca or Cyrene's torrid soil,<br/>

Levied to side with warring winds, and poise<br/>

Their lighter wings.  To whom these most adhere<br/>

He rules a moment: Chaos umpire sits,<br/>

And by decision more embroils the fray<br/>

By which he reigns: next him, high arbiter,<br/>

Chance governs all.  Into this wild Abyss,<br/>

The womb of Nature, and perhaps her grave,<br/>

Of neither sea, nor shore, nor air, nor fire,<br/>

But all these in their pregnant causes mixed<br/>

Confusedly, and which thus must ever fight,<br/>

Unless th' Almighty Maker them ordain<br/>

His dark materials to create more worlds—<br/>

Into this wild Abyss the wary Fiend<br/>

Stood on the brink of Hell and looked a while,<br/>

Pondering his voyage; for no narrow frith<br/>

He had to cross.  Nor was his ear less pealed<br/>

With noises loud and ruinous (to compare<br/>

Great things with small) than when Bellona storms<br/>

With all her battering engines, bent to rase<br/>

Some capital city; or less than if this frame<br/>

Of Heaven were falling, and these elements<br/>

In mutiny had from her axle torn<br/>

The steadfast Earth.  At last his sail-broad vans<br/>

He spread for flight, and, in the surging smoke<br/>

Uplifted, spurns the ground; thence many a league,<br/>

As in a cloudy chair, ascending rides<br/>

Audacious; but, that seat soon failing, meets<br/>

A vast vacuity.  All unawares,<br/>

Fluttering his pennons vain, plumb-down he drops<br/>

Ten thousand fathom deep, and to this hour<br/>

Down had been falling, had not, by ill chance,<br/>

The strong rebuff of some tumultuous cloud,<br/>

Instinct with fire and nitre, hurried him<br/>

As many miles aloft.  That fury stayed—<br/>

Quenched in a boggy Syrtis, neither sea,<br/>

Nor good dry land—nigh foundered, on he fares,<br/>

Treading the crude consistence, half on foot,<br/>

Half flying; behoves him now both oar and sail.<br/>

As when a gryphon through the wilderness<br/>

With winged course, o'er hill or moory dale,<br/>

Pursues the Arimaspian, who by stealth<br/>

Had from his wakeful custody purloined<br/>

The guarded gold; so eagerly the Fiend<br/>

O'er bog or steep, through strait, rough, dense, or rare,<br/>

With head, hands, wings, or feet, pursues his way,<br/>

And swims, or sinks, or wades, or creeps, or flies.<br/>

At length a universal hubbub wild<br/>

Of stunning sounds, and voices all confused,<br/>

Borne through the hollow dark, assaults his ear<br/>

With loudest vehemence.  Thither he plies<br/>

Undaunted, to meet there whatever Power<br/>

Or Spirit of the nethermost Abyss<br/>

Might in that noise reside, of whom to ask<br/>

Which way the nearest coast of darkness lies<br/>

Bordering on light; when straight behold the throne<br/>

Of Chaos, and his dark pavilion spread<br/>

Wide on the wasteful Deep! With him enthroned<br/>

Sat sable-vested Night, eldest of things,<br/>

The consort of his reign; and by them stood<br/>

Orcus and Ades, and the dreaded name<br/>

Of Demogorgon; Rumour next, and Chance,<br/>

And Tumult, and Confusion, all embroiled,<br/>

And Discord with a thousand various mouths.<br/>

  T' whom Satan, turning boldly, thus:—"Ye Powers<br/>

And Spirits of this nethermost Abyss,<br/>

Chaos and ancient Night, I come no spy<br/>

With purpose to explore or to disturb<br/>

The secrets of your realm; but, by constraint<br/>

Wandering this darksome desert, as my way<br/>

Lies through your spacious empire up to light,<br/>

Alone and without guide, half lost, I seek,<br/>

What readiest path leads where your gloomy bounds<br/>

Confine with Heaven; or, if some other place,<br/>

From your dominion won, th' Ethereal King<br/>

Possesses lately, thither to arrive<br/>

I travel this profound.  Direct my course:<br/>

Directed, no mean recompense it brings<br/>

To your behoof, if I that region lost,<br/>

All usurpation thence expelled, reduce<br/>

To her original darkness and your sway<br/>

(Which is my present journey), and once more<br/>

Erect the standard there of ancient Night.<br/>

Yours be th' advantage all, mine the revenge!"<br/>

  Thus Satan; and him thus the Anarch old,<br/>

With faltering speech and visage incomposed,<br/>

Answered:  "I know thee, stranger, who thou art—<br/>

That mighty leading Angel, who of late<br/>

Made head against Heaven's King, though overthrown.<br/>

I saw and heard; for such a numerous host<br/>

Fled not in silence through the frighted Deep,<br/>

With ruin upon ruin, rout on rout,<br/>

Confusion worse confounded; and Heaven-gates<br/>

Poured out by millions her victorious bands,<br/>

Pursuing.  I upon my frontiers here<br/>

Keep residence; if all I can will serve<br/>

That little which is left so to defend,<br/>

Encroached on still through our intestine broils<br/>

Weakening the sceptre of old Night: first, Hell,<br/>

Your dungeon, stretching far and wide beneath;<br/>

Now lately Heaven and Earth, another world<br/>

Hung o'er my realm, linked in a golden chain<br/>

To that side Heaven from whence your legions fell!<br/>

If that way be your walk, you have not far;<br/>

So much the nearer danger.  Go, and speed;<br/>

Havoc, and spoil, and ruin, are my gain."<br/>

  He ceased; and Satan stayed not to reply,<br/>

But, glad that now his sea should find a shore,<br/>

With fresh alacrity and force renewed<br/>

Springs upward, like a pyramid of fire,<br/>

Into the wild expanse, and through the shock<br/>

Of fighting elements, on all sides round<br/>

Environed, wins his way; harder beset<br/>

And more endangered than when Argo passed<br/>

Through Bosporus betwixt the justling rocks,<br/>

Or when Ulysses on the larboard shunned<br/>

Charybdis, and by th' other whirlpool steered.<br/>

So he with difficulty and labour hard<br/>

Moved on, with difficulty and labour he;<br/>

But, he once passed, soon after, when Man fell,<br/>

Strange alteration! Sin and Death amain,<br/>

Following his track (such was the will of Heaven)<br/>

Paved after him a broad and beaten way<br/>

Over the dark Abyss, whose boiling gulf<br/>

Tamely endured a bridge of wondrous length,<br/>

From Hell continued, reaching th' utmost orb<br/>

Of this frail World; by which the Spirits perverse<br/>

With easy intercourse pass to and fro<br/>

To tempt or punish mortals, except whom<br/>

God and good Angels guard by special grace.<br/>

  But now at last the sacred influence<br/>

Of light appears, and from the walls of Heaven<br/>

Shoots far into the bosom of dim Night<br/>

A glimmering dawn.  Here Nature first begins<br/>

Her farthest verge, and Chaos to retire,<br/>

As from her outmost works, a broken foe,<br/>

With tumult less and with less hostile din;<br/>

That Satan with less toil, and now with ease,<br/>

Wafts on the calmer wave by dubious light,<br/>

And, like a weather-beaten vessel, holds<br/>

Gladly the port, though shrouds and tackle torn;<br/>

Or in the emptier waste, resembling air,<br/>

Weighs his spread wings, at leisure to behold<br/>

Far off th' empyreal Heaven, extended wide<br/>

In circuit, undetermined square or round,<br/>

With opal towers and battlements adorned<br/>

Of living sapphire, once his native seat;<br/>

And, fast by, hanging in a golden chain,<br/>

This pendent World, in bigness as a star<br/>

Of smallest magnitude close by the moon.<br/>

Thither, full fraught with mischievous revenge,<br/>

Accursed, and in a cursed hour, he hies.<br/>
</p>
<h3 id="id00020" style="margin-top: 3em">Book III</h3>
<p id="id00021" style="margin-top: 2em">Hail, holy Light, offspring of Heaven firstborn,<br/>

Or of the Eternal coeternal beam<br/>

May I express thee unblam'd?  since God is light,<br/>

And never but in unapproached light<br/>

Dwelt from eternity, dwelt then in thee<br/>

Bright effluence of bright essence increate.<br/>

Or hear'st thou rather pure ethereal stream,<br/>

Whose fountain who shall tell?  before the sun,<br/>

Before the Heavens thou wert, and at the voice<br/>

Of God, as with a mantle, didst invest<br/>

The rising world of waters dark and deep,<br/>

Won from the void and formless infinite.<br/>

Thee I re-visit now with bolder wing,<br/>

Escap'd the Stygian pool, though long detain'd<br/>

In that obscure sojourn, while in my flight<br/>

Through utter and through middle darkness borne,<br/>

With other notes than to the Orphean lyre<br/>

I sung of Chaos and eternal Night;<br/>

Taught by the heavenly Muse to venture down<br/>

The dark descent, and up to re-ascend,<br/>

Though hard and rare:  Thee I revisit safe,<br/>

And feel thy sovran vital lamp; but thou<br/>

Revisit'st not these eyes, that roll in vain<br/>

To find thy piercing ray, and find no dawn;<br/>

So thick a drop serene hath quench'd their orbs,<br/>

Or dim suffusion veil'd.  Yet not the more<br/>

Cease I to wander, where the Muses haunt,<br/>

Clear spring, or shady grove, or sunny hill,<br/>

Smit with the love of sacred song; but chief<br/>

Thee, Sion, and the flowery brooks beneath,<br/>

That wash thy hallow'd feet, and warbling flow,<br/>

Nightly I visit:  nor sometimes forget<br/>

So were I equall'd with them in renown,<br/>

Thy sovran command, that Man should find grace;<br/>

Blind Thamyris, and blind Maeonides,<br/>

And Tiresias, and Phineus, prophets old:<br/>

Then feed on thoughts, that voluntary move<br/>

Harmonious numbers; as the wakeful bird<br/>

Sings darkling, and in shadiest covert hid<br/>

Tunes her nocturnal note.  Thus with the year<br/>

Seasons return; but not to me returns<br/>

Day, or the sweet approach of even or morn,<br/>

Or sight of vernal bloom, or summer's rose,<br/>

Or flocks, or herds, or human face divine;<br/>

But cloud instead, and ever-during dark<br/>

Surrounds me, from the cheerful ways of men<br/>

Cut off, and for the book of knowledge fair<br/>

Presented with a universal blank<br/>

Of nature's works to me expung'd and ras'd,<br/>

And wisdom at one entrance quite shut out.<br/>

So much the rather thou, celestial Light,<br/>

Shine inward, and the mind through all her powers<br/>

Irradiate; there plant eyes, all mist from thence<br/>

Purge and disperse, that I may see and tell<br/>

Of things invisible to mortal sight.<br/>

Now had the Almighty Father from above,<br/>

From the pure empyrean where he sits<br/>

High thron'd above all highth, bent down his eye<br/>

His own works and their works at once to view:<br/>

About him all the Sanctities of Heaven<br/>

Stood thick as stars, and from his sight receiv'd<br/>

Beatitude past utterance; on his right<br/>

The radiant image of his glory sat,<br/>

His only son; on earth he first beheld<br/>

Our two first parents, yet the only two<br/>

Of mankind in the happy garden plac'd<br/>

Reaping immortal fruits of joy and love,<br/>

Uninterrupted joy, unrivall'd love,<br/>

In blissful solitude; he then survey'd<br/>

Hell and the gulf between, and Satan there<br/>

Coasting the wall of Heaven on this side Night<br/>

In the dun air sublime, and ready now<br/>

To stoop with wearied wings, and willing feet,<br/>

On the bare outside of this world, that seem'd<br/>

Firm land imbosom'd, without firmament,<br/>

Uncertain which, in ocean or in air.<br/>

Him God beholding from his prospect high,<br/>

Wherein past, present, future, he beholds,<br/>

Thus to his only Son foreseeing spake.<br/>

Only begotten Son, seest thou what rage<br/>

Transports our Adversary?  whom no bounds<br/>

Prescrib'd no bars of Hell, nor all the chains<br/>

Heap'd on him there, nor yet the main abyss<br/>

Wide interrupt, can hold; so bent he seems<br/>

On desperate revenge, that shall redound<br/>

Upon his own rebellious head.  And now,<br/>

Through all restraint broke loose, he wings his way<br/>

Not far off Heaven, in the precincts of light,<br/>

Directly towards the new created world,<br/>

And man there plac'd, with purpose to assay<br/>

If him by force he can destroy, or, worse,<br/>

By some false guile pervert; and shall pervert;<br/>

For man will hearken to his glozing lies,<br/>

And easily transgress the sole command,<br/>

Sole pledge of his obedience:  So will fall<br/>

He and his faithless progeny:  Whose fault?<br/>

Whose but his own?  ingrate, he had of me<br/>

All he could have; I made him just and right,<br/>

Sufficient to have stood, though free to fall.<br/>

Such I created all the ethereal Powers<br/>

And Spirits, both them who stood, and them who fail'd;<br/>

Freely they stood who stood, and fell who fell.<br/>

Not free, what proof could they have given sincere<br/>

Of true allegiance, constant faith or love,<br/>

Where only what they needs must do appear'd,<br/>

Not what they would?  what praise could they receive?<br/>

What pleasure I from such obedience paid,<br/>

When will and reason (reason also is choice)<br/>

Useless and vain, of freedom both despoil'd,<br/>

Made passive both, had serv'd necessity,<br/>

Not me.  They therefore, as to right belong'd,<br/>

So were created, nor can justly accuse<br/>

Their Maker, or their making, or their fate,<br/>

As if predestination over-rul'd<br/>

Their will dispos'd by absolute decree<br/>

Or high foreknowledge they themselves decreed<br/>

Their own revolt, not I; if I foreknew,<br/>

Foreknowledge had no influence on their fault,<br/>

Which had no less proved certain unforeknown.<br/>

So without least impulse or shadow of fate,<br/>

Or aught by me immutably foreseen,<br/>

They trespass, authors to themselves in all<br/>

Both what they judge, and what they choose; for so<br/>

I form'd them free: and free they must remain,<br/>

Till they enthrall themselves; I else must change<br/>

Their nature, and revoke the high decree<br/>

Unchangeable, eternal, which ordain'd<br/>

Their freedom: they themselves ordain'd their fall.<br/>

The first sort by their own suggestion fell,<br/>

Self-tempted, self-deprav'd:  Man falls, deceiv'd<br/>

By the other first:  Man therefore shall find grace,<br/>

The other none:  In mercy and justice both,<br/>

Through Heaven and Earth, so shall my glory excel;<br/>

But Mercy, first and last, shall brightest shine.<br/>

Thus while God spake, ambrosial fragrance fill'd<br/>

All Heaven, and in the blessed Spirits elect<br/>

Sense of new joy ineffable diffus'd.<br/>

Beyond compare the Son of God was seen<br/>

Most glorious; in him all his Father shone<br/>

Substantially express'd; and in his face<br/>

Divine compassion visibly appear'd,<br/>

Love without end, and without measure grace,<br/>

Which uttering, thus he to his Father spake.<br/>

O Father, gracious was that word which clos'd<br/>

Thy sovran command, that Man should find grace;<br/>

For which both Heaven and earth shall high extol<br/>

Thy praises, with the innumerable sound<br/>

Of hymns and sacred songs, wherewith thy throne<br/>

Encompass'd shall resound thee ever blest.<br/>

For should Man finally be lost, should Man,<br/>

Thy creature late so lov'd, thy youngest son,<br/>

Fall circumvented thus by fraud, though join'd<br/>

With his own folly?  that be from thee far,<br/>

That far be from thee, Father, who art judge<br/>

Of all things made, and judgest only right.<br/>

Or shall the Adversary thus obtain<br/>

His end, and frustrate thine?  shall he fulfill<br/>

His malice, and thy goodness bring to nought,<br/>

Or proud return, though to his heavier doom,<br/>

Yet with revenge accomplish'd, and to Hell<br/>

Draw after him the whole race of mankind,<br/>

By him corrupted?  or wilt thou thyself<br/>

Abolish thy creation, and unmake<br/>

For him, what for thy glory thou hast made?<br/>

So should thy goodness and thy greatness both<br/>

Be question'd and blasphem'd without defence.<br/>

To whom the great Creator thus replied.<br/>

O son, in whom my soul hath chief delight,<br/>

Son of my bosom, Son who art alone.<br/>

My word, my wisdom, and effectual might,<br/>

All hast thou spoken as my thoughts are, all<br/>

As my eternal purpose hath decreed;<br/>

Man shall not quite be lost, but sav'd who will;<br/>

Yet not of will in him, but grace in me<br/>

Freely vouchsaf'd; once more I will renew<br/>

His lapsed powers, though forfeit; and enthrall'd<br/>

By sin to foul exorbitant desires;<br/>

Upheld by me, yet once more he shall stand<br/>

On even ground against his mortal foe;<br/>

By me upheld, that he may know how frail<br/>

His fallen condition is, and to me owe<br/>

All his deliverance, and to none but me.<br/>

Some I have chosen of peculiar grace,<br/>

Elect above the rest; so is my will:<br/>

The rest shall hear me call, and oft be warn'd<br/>

Their sinful state, and to appease betimes<br/>

The incensed Deity, while offer'd grace<br/>

Invites; for I will clear their senses dark,<br/>

What may suffice, and soften stony hearts<br/>

To pray, repent, and bring obedience due.<br/>

To prayer, repentance, and obedience due,<br/>

Though but endeavour'd with sincere intent,<br/>

Mine ear shall not be slow, mine eye not shut.<br/>

And I will place within them as a guide,<br/>

My umpire Conscience; whom if they will hear,<br/>

Light after light, well us'd, they shall attain,<br/>

And to the end, persisting, safe arrive.<br/>

This my long sufferance, and my day of grace,<br/>

They who neglect and scorn, shall never taste;<br/>

But hard be harden'd, blind be blinded more,<br/>

That they may stumble on, and deeper fall;<br/>

And none but such from mercy I exclude.<br/>

But yet all is not done; Man disobeying,<br/>

Disloyal, breaks his fealty, and sins<br/>

Against the high supremacy of Heaven,<br/>

Affecting God-head, and, so losing all,<br/>

To expiate his treason hath nought left,<br/>

But to destruction sacred and devote,<br/>

He, with his whole posterity, must die,<br/>

Die he or justice must; unless for him<br/>

Some other able, and as willing, pay<br/>

The rigid satisfaction, death for death.<br/>

Say, heavenly Powers, where shall we find such love?<br/>

Which of you will be mortal, to redeem<br/>

Man's mortal crime, and just the unjust to save?<br/>

Dwells in all Heaven charity so dear?<br/>

He ask'd, but all the heavenly quire stood mute,<br/>

And silence was in Heaven: on Man's behalf<br/>

Patron or intercessour none appear'd,<br/>

Much less that durst upon his own head draw<br/>

The deadly forfeiture, and ransom set.<br/>

And now without redemption all mankind<br/>

Must have been lost, adjudg'd to Death and Hell<br/>

By doom severe, had not the Son of God,<br/>

In whom the fulness dwells of love divine,<br/>

His dearest mediation thus renew'd.<br/>

Father, thy word is past, Man shall find grace;<br/>

And shall grace not find means, that finds her way,<br/>

The speediest of thy winged messengers,<br/>

To visit all thy creatures, and to all<br/>

Comes unprevented, unimplor'd, unsought?<br/>

Happy for Man, so coming; he her aid<br/>

Can never seek, once dead in sins, and lost;<br/>

Atonement for himself, or offering meet,<br/>

Indebted and undone, hath none to bring;<br/>

Behold me then:  me for him, life for life<br/>

I offer: on me let thine anger fall;<br/>

Account me Man; I for his sake will leave<br/>

Thy bosom, and this glory next to thee<br/>

Freely put off, and for him lastly die<br/>

Well pleased; on me let Death wreak all his rage.<br/>

Under his gloomy power I shall not long<br/>

Lie vanquished.  Thou hast given me to possess<br/>

Life in myself for ever; by thee I live;<br/>

Though now to Death I yield, and am his due,<br/>

All that of me can die, yet, that debt paid,<br/>

Thou wilt not leave me in the loathsome grave<br/>

His prey, nor suffer my unspotted soul<br/>

For ever with corruption there to dwell;<br/>

But I shall rise victorious, and subdue<br/>

My vanquisher, spoiled of his vaunted spoil.<br/>

Death his death's wound shall then receive, and stoop<br/>

Inglorious, of his mortal sting disarmed;<br/>

I through the ample air in triumph high<br/>

Shall lead Hell captive maugre Hell, and show<br/>

The powers of darkness bound.  Thou, at the sight<br/>

Pleased, out of Heaven shalt look down and smile,<br/>

While, by thee raised, I ruin all my foes;<br/>

Death last, and with his carcase glut the grave;<br/>

Then, with the multitude of my redeemed,<br/>

Shall enter Heaven, long absent, and return,<br/>

Father, to see thy face, wherein no cloud<br/>

Of anger shall remain, but peace assured<br/>

And reconcilement: wrath shall be no more<br/>

Thenceforth, but in thy presence joy entire.<br/>

  His words here ended; but his meek aspect<br/>

Silent yet spake, and breathed immortal love<br/>

To mortal men, above which only shone<br/>

Filial obedience: as a sacrifice<br/>

Glad to be offered, he attends the will<br/>

Of his great Father.  Admiration seized<br/>

All Heaven, what this might mean, and whither tend,<br/>

Wondering; but soon th' Almighty thus replied:<br/>

  O thou in Heaven and Earth the only peace<br/>

Found out for mankind under wrath, O thou<br/>

My sole complacence! Well thou know'st how dear<br/>

To me are all my works; nor Man the least,<br/>

Though last created, that for him I spare<br/>

Thee from my bosom and right hand, to save,<br/>

By losing thee a while, the whole race lost.<br/>

Thou, therefore, whom thou only canst redeem,<br/>

Their nature also to thy nature join;<br/>

And be thyself Man among men on Earth,<br/>

Made flesh, when time shall be, of virgin seed,<br/>

By wondrous birth; be thou in Adam's room<br/>

The head of all mankind, though Adam's son.<br/>

As in him perish all men, so in thee,<br/>

As from a second root, shall be restored<br/>

As many as are restored, without thee none.<br/>

His crime makes guilty all his sons; thy merit,<br/>

Imputed, shall absolve them who renounce<br/>

Their own both righteous and unrighteous deeds,<br/>

And live in thee transplanted, and from thee<br/>

Receive new life.  So Man, as is most just,<br/>

Shall satisfy for Man, be judged and die,<br/>

And dying rise, and rising with him raise<br/>

His brethren, ransomed with his own dear life.<br/>

So heavenly love shall outdo hellish hate,<br/>

Giving to death, and dying to redeem,<br/>

So dearly to redeem what hellish hate<br/>

So easily destroyed, and still destroys<br/>

In those who, when they may, accept not grace.<br/>

Nor shalt thou, by descending to assume<br/>

Man's nature, lessen or degrade thine own.<br/>

Because thou hast, though throned in highest bliss<br/>

Equal to God, and equally enjoying<br/>

God-like fruition, quitted all, to save<br/>

A world from utter loss, and hast been found<br/>

By merit more than birthright Son of God,<br/>

Found worthiest to be so by being good,<br/>

Far more than great or high; because in thee<br/>

Love hath abounded more than glory abounds;<br/>

Therefore thy humiliation shall exalt<br/>

With thee thy manhood also to this throne:<br/>

Here shalt thou sit incarnate, here shalt reign<br/>

Both God and Man, Son both of God and Man,<br/>

Anointed universal King; all power<br/>

I give thee; reign for ever, and assume<br/>

Thy merits; under thee, as head supreme,<br/>

Thrones, Princedoms, Powers, Dominions, I reduce:<br/>

All knees to thee shall bow, of them that bide<br/>

In Heaven, or Earth, or under Earth in Hell.<br/>

When thou, attended gloriously from Heaven,<br/>

Shalt in the sky appear, and from thee send<br/>

The summoning Arch-Angels to proclaim<br/>

Thy dread tribunal; forthwith from all winds,<br/>

The living, and forthwith the cited dead<br/>

Of all past ages, to the general doom<br/>

Shall hasten; such a peal shall rouse their sleep.<br/>

Then, all thy saints assembled, thou shalt judge<br/>

Bad Men and Angels; they, arraigned, shall sink<br/>

Beneath thy sentence; Hell, her numbers full,<br/>

Thenceforth shall be for ever shut.  Mean while<br/>

The world shall burn, and from her ashes spring<br/>

New Heaven and Earth, wherein the just shall dwell,<br/>

And, after all their tribulations long,<br/>

See golden days, fruitful of golden deeds,<br/>

With joy and peace triumphing, and fair truth.<br/>

Then thou thy regal scepter shalt lay by,<br/>

For regal scepter then no more shall need,<br/>

God shall be all in all.  But, all ye Gods,<br/>

Adore him, who to compass all this dies;<br/>

Adore the Son, and honour him as me.<br/>

No sooner had the Almighty ceased, but all<br/>

The multitude of Angels, with a shout<br/>

Loud as from numbers without number, sweet<br/>

As from blest voices, uttering joy, Heaven rung<br/>

With jubilee, and loud Hosannas filled<br/>

The eternal regions:  Lowly reverent<br/>

Towards either throne they bow, and to the ground<br/>

With solemn adoration down they cast<br/>

Their crowns inwove with amarant and gold;<br/>

Immortal amarant, a flower which once<br/>

In Paradise, fast by the tree of life,<br/>

Began to bloom; but soon for man's offence<br/>

To Heaven removed, where first it grew, there grows,<br/>

And flowers aloft shading the fount of life,<br/>

And where the river of bliss through midst of Heaven<br/>

Rolls o'er Elysian flowers her amber stream;<br/>

With these that never fade the Spirits elect<br/>

Bind their resplendent locks inwreathed with beams;<br/>

Now in loose garlands thick thrown off, the bright<br/>

Pavement, that like a sea of jasper shone,<br/>

Impurpled with celestial roses smiled.<br/>

Then, crowned again, their golden harps they took,<br/>

Harps ever tuned, that glittering by their side<br/>

Like quivers hung, and with preamble sweet<br/>

Of charming symphony they introduce<br/>

Their sacred song, and waken raptures high;<br/>

No voice exempt, no voice but well could join<br/>

Melodious part, such concord is in Heaven.<br/>

Thee, Father, first they sung Omnipotent,<br/>

Immutable, Immortal, Infinite,<br/>

Eternal King; the Author of all being,<br/>

Fountain of light, thyself invisible<br/>

Amidst the glorious brightness where thou sit'st<br/>

Throned inaccessible, but when thou shadest<br/>

The full blaze of thy beams, and, through a cloud<br/>

Drawn round about thee like a radiant shrine,<br/>

Dark with excessive bright thy skirts appear,<br/>

Yet dazzle Heaven, that brightest Seraphim<br/>

Approach not, but with both wings veil their eyes.<br/>

Thee next they sang of all creation first,<br/>

Begotten Son, Divine Similitude,<br/>

In whose conspicuous countenance, without cloud<br/>

Made visible, the Almighty Father shines,<br/>

Whom else no creature can behold; on thee<br/>

Impressed the effulgence of his glory abides,<br/>

Transfused on thee his ample Spirit rests.<br/>

He Heaven of Heavens and all the Powers therein<br/>

By thee created; and by thee threw down<br/>

The aspiring Dominations:  Thou that day<br/>

Thy Father's dreadful thunder didst not spare,<br/>

Nor stop thy flaming chariot-wheels, that shook<br/>

Heaven's everlasting frame, while o'er the necks<br/>

Thou drovest of warring Angels disarrayed.<br/>

Back from pursuit thy Powers with loud acclaim<br/>

Thee only extolled, Son of thy Father's might,<br/>

To execute fierce vengeance on his foes,<br/>

Not so on Man:  Him through their malice fallen,<br/>

Father of mercy and grace, thou didst not doom<br/>

So strictly, but much more to pity incline:<br/>

No sooner did thy dear and only Son<br/>

Perceive thee purposed not to doom frail Man<br/>

So strictly, but much more to pity inclined,<br/>

He to appease thy wrath, and end the strife<br/>

Of mercy and justice in thy face discerned,<br/>

Regardless of the bliss wherein he sat<br/>

Second to thee, offered himself to die<br/>

For Man's offence.  O unexampled love,<br/>

Love no where to be found less than Divine!<br/>

Hail, Son of God, Saviour of Men!  Thy name<br/>

Shall be the copious matter of my song<br/>

Henceforth, and never shall my heart thy praise<br/>

Forget, nor from thy Father's praise disjoin.<br/>

Thus they in Heaven, above the starry sphere,<br/>

Their happy hours in joy and hymning spent.<br/>

Mean while upon the firm opacous globe<br/>

Of this round world, whose first convex divides<br/>

The luminous inferiour orbs, enclosed<br/>

From Chaos, and the inroad of Darkness old,<br/>

Satan alighted walks:  A globe far off<br/>

It seemed, now seems a boundless continent<br/>

Dark, waste, and wild, under the frown of Night<br/>

Starless exposed, and ever-threatening storms<br/>

Of Chaos blustering round, inclement sky;<br/>

Save on that side which from the wall of Heaven,<br/>

Though distant far, some small reflection gains<br/>

Of glimmering air less vexed with tempest loud:<br/>

Here walked the Fiend at large in spacious field.<br/>

As when a vultur on Imaus bred,<br/>

Whose snowy ridge the roving Tartar bounds,<br/>

Dislodging from a region scarce of prey<br/>

To gorge the flesh of lambs or yeanling kids,<br/>

On hills where flocks are fed, flies toward the springs<br/>

Of Ganges or Hydaspes, Indian streams;<br/>

But in his way lights on the barren plains<br/>

Of Sericana, where Chineses drive<br/>

With sails and wind their cany waggons light:<br/>

So, on this windy sea of land, the Fiend<br/>

Walked up and down alone, bent on his prey;<br/>

Alone, for other creature in this place,<br/>

Living or lifeless, to be found was none;<br/>

None yet, but store hereafter from the earth<br/>

Up hither like aereal vapours flew<br/>

Of all things transitory and vain, when sin<br/>

With vanity had filled the works of men:<br/>

Both all things vain, and all who in vain things<br/>

Built their fond hopes of glory or lasting fame,<br/>

Or happiness in this or the other life;<br/>

All who have their reward on earth, the fruits<br/>

Of painful superstition and blind zeal,<br/>

Nought seeking but the praise of men, here find<br/>

Fit retribution, empty as their deeds;<br/>

All the unaccomplished works of Nature's hand,<br/>

Abortive, monstrous, or unkindly mixed,<br/>

Dissolved on earth, fleet hither, and in vain,<br/>

Till final dissolution, wander here;<br/>

Not in the neighbouring moon as some have dreamed;<br/>

Those argent fields more likely habitants,<br/>

Translated Saints, or middle Spirits hold<br/>

Betwixt the angelical and human kind.<br/>

Hither of ill-joined sons and daughters born<br/>

First from the ancient world those giants came<br/>

With many a vain exploit, though then renowned:<br/>

The builders next of Babel on the plain<br/>

Of Sennaar, and still with vain design,<br/>

New Babels, had they wherewithal, would build:<br/>

Others came single; he, who, to be deemed<br/>

A God, leaped fondly into Aetna flames,<br/>

Empedocles; and he, who, to enjoy<br/>

Plato's Elysium, leaped into the sea,<br/>

Cleombrotus; and many more too long,<br/>

Embryos, and idiots, eremites, and friars<br/>

White, black, and gray, with all their trumpery.<br/>

Here pilgrims roam, that strayed so far to seek<br/>

In Golgotha him dead, who lives in Heaven;<br/>

And they, who to be sure of Paradise,<br/>

Dying, put on the weeds of Dominick,<br/>

Or in Franciscan think to pass disguised;<br/>

They pass the planets seven, and pass the fixed,<br/>

And that crystalling sphere whose balance weighs<br/>

The trepidation talked, and that first moved;<br/>

And now Saint Peter at Heaven's wicket seems<br/>

To wait them with his keys, and now at foot<br/>

Of Heaven's ascent they lift their feet, when lo<br/>

A violent cross wind from either coast<br/>

Blows them transverse, ten thousand leagues awry<br/>

Into the devious air:  Then might ye see<br/>

Cowls, hoods, and habits, with their wearers, tost<br/>

And fluttered into rags; then reliques, beads,<br/>

Indulgences, dispenses, pardons, bulls,<br/>

The sport of winds:  All these, upwhirled aloft,<br/>

Fly o'er the backside of the world far off<br/>

Into a Limbo large and broad, since called<br/>

The Paradise of Fools, to few unknown<br/>

Long after; now unpeopled, and untrod.<br/>

All this dark globe the Fiend found as he passed,<br/>

And long he wandered, till at last a gleam<br/>

Of dawning light turned thither-ward in haste<br/>

His travelled steps: far distant he descries<br/>

Ascending by degrees magnificent<br/>

Up to the wall of Heaven a structure high;<br/>

At top whereof, but far more rich, appeared<br/>

The work as of a kingly palace-gate,<br/>

With frontispiece of diamond and gold<br/>

Embellished; thick with sparkling orient gems<br/>

The portal shone, inimitable on earth<br/>

By model, or by shading pencil, drawn.<br/>

These stairs were such as whereon Jacob saw<br/>

Angels ascending and descending, bands<br/>

Of guardians bright, when he from Esau fled<br/>

To Padan-Aram, in the field of Luz<br/>

Dreaming by night under the open sky<br/>

And waking cried,  This is the gate of Heaven.<br/>

Each stair mysteriously was meant, nor stood<br/>

There always, but drawn up to Heaven sometimes<br/>

Viewless; and underneath a bright sea flowed<br/>

Of jasper, or of liquid pearl, whereon<br/>

Who after came from earth, failing arrived<br/>

Wafted by Angels, or flew o'er the lake<br/>

Rapt in a chariot drawn by fiery steeds.<br/>

The stairs were then let down, whether to dare<br/>

The Fiend by easy ascent, or aggravate<br/>

His sad exclusion from the doors of bliss:<br/>

Direct against which opened from beneath,<br/>

Just o'er the blissful seat of Paradise,<br/>

A passage down to the Earth, a passage wide,<br/>

Wider by far than that of after-times<br/>

Over mount Sion, and, though that were large,<br/>

Over the Promised Land to God so dear;<br/>

By which, to visit oft those happy tribes,<br/>

On high behests his angels to and fro<br/>

Passed frequent, and his eye with choice regard<br/>

From Paneas, the fount of Jordan's flood,<br/>

To Beersaba, where the Holy Land<br/>

Borders on Egypt and the Arabian shore;<br/>

So wide the opening seemed, where bounds were set<br/>

To darkness, such as bound the ocean wave.<br/>

Satan from hence, now on the lower stair,<br/>

That scaled by steps of gold to Heaven-gate,<br/>

Looks down with wonder at the sudden view<br/>

Of all this world at once.  As when a scout,<br/>

Through dark and desert ways with peril gone<br/>

All night; at last by break of cheerful dawn<br/>

Obtains the brow of some high-climbing hill,<br/>

Which to his eye discovers unaware<br/>

The goodly prospect of some foreign land<br/>

First seen, or some renowned metropolis<br/>

With glistering spires and pinnacles adorned,<br/>

Which now the rising sun gilds with his beams:<br/>

Such wonder seised, though after Heaven seen,<br/>

The Spirit malign, but much more envy seised,<br/>

At sight of all this world beheld so fair.<br/>

Round he surveys (and well might, where he stood<br/>

So high above the circling canopy<br/>

Of night's extended shade,) from eastern point<br/>

Of Libra to the fleecy star that bears<br/>

Andromeda far off Atlantick seas<br/>

Beyond the horizon; then from pole to pole<br/>

He views in breadth, and without longer pause<br/>

Down right into the world's first region throws<br/>

His flight precipitant, and winds with ease<br/>

Through the pure marble air his oblique way<br/>

Amongst innumerable stars, that shone<br/>

Stars distant, but nigh hand seemed other worlds;<br/>

Or other worlds they seemed, or happy isles,<br/>

Like those Hesperian gardens famed of old,<br/>

Fortunate fields, and groves, and flowery vales,<br/>

Thrice happy isles; but who dwelt happy there<br/>

He staid not to inquire:  Above them all<br/>

The golden sun, in splendour likest Heaven,<br/>

Allured his eye; thither his course he bends<br/>

Through the calm firmament, (but up or down,<br/>

By center, or eccentrick, hard to tell,<br/>

Or longitude,) where the great luminary<br/>

Aloof the vulgar constellations thick,<br/>

That from his lordly eye keep distance due,<br/>

Dispenses light from far; they, as they move<br/>

Their starry dance in numbers that compute<br/>

Days, months, and years, towards his all-cheering lamp<br/>

Turn swift their various motions, or are turned<br/>

By his magnetick beam, that gently warms<br/>

The universe, and to each inward part<br/>

With gentle penetration, though unseen,<br/>

Shoots invisible virtue even to the deep;<br/>

So wonderously was set his station bright.<br/>

There lands the Fiend, a spot like which perhaps<br/>

Astronomer in the sun's lucent orb<br/>

Through his glazed optick tube yet never saw.<br/>

The place he found beyond expression bright,<br/>

Compared with aught on earth, metal or stone;<br/>

Not all parts like, but all alike informed<br/>

With radiant light, as glowing iron with fire;<br/>

If metal, part seemed gold, part silver clear;<br/>

If stone, carbuncle most or chrysolite,<br/>

Ruby or topaz, to the twelve that shone<br/>

In Aaron's breast-plate, and a stone besides<br/>

Imagined rather oft than elsewhere seen,<br/>

That stone, or like to that which here below<br/>

Philosophers in vain so long have sought,<br/>

In vain, though by their powerful art they bind<br/>

Volatile Hermes, and call up unbound<br/>

In various shapes old Proteus from the sea,<br/>

Drained through a limbeck to his native form.<br/>

What wonder then if fields and regions here<br/>

Breathe forth Elixir pure, and rivers run<br/>

Potable gold, when with one virtuous touch<br/>

The arch-chemick sun, so far from us remote,<br/>

Produces, with terrestrial humour mixed,<br/>

Here in the dark so many precious things<br/>

Of colour glorious, and effect so rare?<br/>

Here matter new to gaze the Devil met<br/>

Undazzled; far and wide his eye commands;<br/>

For sight no obstacle found here, nor shade,<br/>

But all sun-shine, as when his beams at noon<br/>

Culminate from the equator, as they now<br/>

Shot upward still direct, whence no way round<br/>

Shadow from body opaque can fall; and the air,<br/>

No where so clear, sharpened his visual ray<br/>

To objects distant far, whereby he soon<br/>

Saw within ken a glorious Angel stand,<br/>

The same whom John saw also in the sun:<br/>

His back was turned, but not his brightness hid;<br/>

Of beaming sunny rays a golden tiar<br/>

Circled his head, nor less his locks behind<br/>

Illustrious on his shoulders fledge with wings<br/>

Lay waving round; on some great charge employed<br/>

He seemed, or fixed in cogitation deep.<br/>

Glad was the Spirit impure, as now in hope<br/>

To find who might direct his wandering flight<br/>

To Paradise, the happy seat of Man,<br/>

His journey's end and our beginning woe.<br/>

But first he casts to change his proper shape,<br/>

Which else might work him danger or delay:<br/>

And now a stripling Cherub he appears,<br/>

Not of the prime, yet such as in his face<br/>

Youth smiled celestial, and to every limb<br/>

Suitable grace diffused, so well he feigned:<br/>

Under a coronet his flowing hair<br/>

In curls on either cheek played; wings he wore<br/>

Of many a coloured plume, sprinkled with gold;<br/>

His habit fit for speed succinct, and held<br/>

Before his decent steps a silver wand.<br/>

He drew not nigh unheard; the Angel bright,<br/>

Ere he drew nigh, his radiant visage turned,<br/>

Admonished by his ear, and straight was known<br/>

The Arch-Angel Uriel, one of the seven<br/>

Who in God's presence, nearest to his throne,<br/>

Stand ready at command, and are his eyes<br/>

That run through all the Heavens, or down to the Earth<br/>

Bear his swift errands over moist and dry,<br/>

O'er sea and land: him Satan thus accosts.<br/>

Uriel, for thou of those seven Spirits that stand<br/>

In sight of God's high throne, gloriously bright,<br/>

The first art wont his great authentick will<br/>

Interpreter through highest Heaven to bring,<br/>

Where all his sons thy embassy attend;<br/>

And here art likeliest by supreme decree<br/>

Like honour to obtain, and as his eye<br/>

To visit oft this new creation round;<br/>

Unspeakable desire to see, and know<br/>

All these his wonderous works, but chiefly Man,<br/>

His chief delight and favour, him for whom<br/>

All these his works so wonderous he ordained,<br/>

Hath brought me from the quires of Cherubim<br/>

Alone thus wandering.  Brightest Seraph, tell<br/>

In which of all these shining orbs hath Man<br/>

His fixed seat, or fixed seat hath none,<br/>

But all these shining orbs his choice to dwell;<br/>

That I may find him, and with secret gaze<br/>

Or open admiration him behold,<br/>

On whom the great Creator hath bestowed<br/>

Worlds, and on whom hath all these graces poured;<br/>

That both in him and all things, as is meet,<br/>

The universal Maker we may praise;<br/>

Who justly hath driven out his rebel foes<br/>

To deepest Hell, and, to repair that loss,<br/>

Created this new happy race of Men<br/>

To serve him better:  Wise are all his ways.<br/>

So spake the false dissembler unperceived;<br/>

For neither Man nor Angel can discern<br/>

Hypocrisy, the only evil that walks<br/>

Invisible, except to God alone,<br/>

By his permissive will, through Heaven and Earth:<br/>

And oft, though wisdom wake, suspicion sleeps<br/>

At wisdom's gate, and to simplicity<br/>

Resigns her charge, while goodness thinks no ill<br/>

Where no ill seems:  Which now for once beguiled<br/>

Uriel, though regent of the sun, and held<br/>

The sharpest-sighted Spirit of all in Heaven;<br/>

Who to the fraudulent impostor foul,<br/>

In his uprightness, answer thus returned.<br/>

Fair Angel, thy desire, which tends to know<br/>

The works of God, thereby to glorify<br/>

The great Work-master, leads to no excess<br/>

That reaches blame, but rather merits praise<br/>

The more it seems excess, that led thee hither<br/>

From thy empyreal mansion thus alone,<br/>

To witness with thine eyes what some perhaps,<br/>

Contented with report, hear only in Heaven:<br/>

For wonderful indeed are all his works,<br/>

Pleasant to know, and worthiest to be all<br/>

Had in remembrance always with delight;<br/>

But what created mind can comprehend<br/>

Their number, or the wisdom infinite<br/>

That brought them forth, but hid their causes deep?<br/>

I saw when at his word the formless mass,<br/>

This world's material mould, came to a heap:<br/>

Confusion heard his voice, and wild uproar<br/>

Stood ruled, stood vast infinitude confined;<br/>

Till at his second bidding Darkness fled,<br/>

Light shone, and order from disorder sprung:<br/>

Swift to their several quarters hasted then<br/>

The cumbrous elements, earth, flood, air, fire;<br/>

And this ethereal quintessence of Heaven<br/>

Flew upward, spirited with various forms,<br/>

That rolled orbicular, and turned to stars<br/>

Numberless, as thou seest, and how they move;<br/>

Each had his place appointed, each his course;<br/>

The rest in circuit walls this universe.<br/>

Look downward on that globe, whose hither side<br/>

With light from hence, though but reflected, shines;<br/>

That place is Earth, the seat of Man; that light<br/>

His day, which else, as the other hemisphere,<br/>

Night would invade; but there the neighbouring moon<br/>

(So call that opposite fair star) her aid<br/>

Timely interposes, and her monthly round<br/>

Still ending, still renewing, through mid Heaven,<br/>

With borrowed light her countenance triform<br/>

Hence fills and empties to enlighten the Earth,<br/>

And in her pale dominion checks the night.<br/>

That spot, to which I point, is Paradise,<br/>

Adam's abode; those lofty shades, his bower.<br/>

Thy way thou canst not miss, me mine requires.<br/>

Thus said, he turned; and Satan, bowing low,<br/>

As to superiour Spirits is wont in Heaven,<br/>

Where honour due and reverence none neglects,<br/>

Took leave, and toward the coast of earth beneath,<br/>

Down from the ecliptick, sped with hoped success,<br/>

Throws his steep flight in many an aery wheel;<br/>

Nor staid, till on Niphates' top he lights.<br/>
</p>
<h3 id="id00022" style="margin-top: 3em">Book IV</h3>
<p id="id00023" style="margin-top: 2em">O, for that warning voice, which he, who saw<br/>

The Apocalypse, heard cry in Heaven aloud,<br/>

Then when the Dragon, put to second rout,<br/>

Came furious down to be revenged on men,<br/>

Woe to the inhabitants on earth! that now,<br/>

While time was, our first parents had been warned<br/>

The coming of their secret foe, and 'scaped,<br/>

Haply so 'scaped his mortal snare:  For now<br/>

Satan, now first inflamed with rage, came down,<br/>

The tempter ere the accuser of mankind,<br/>

To wreak on innocent frail Man his loss<br/>

Of that first battle, and his flight to Hell:<br/>

Yet, not rejoicing in his speed, though bold<br/>

Far off and fearless, nor with cause to boast,<br/>

Begins his dire attempt; which nigh the birth<br/>

Now rolling boils in his tumultuous breast,<br/>

And like a devilish engine back recoils<br/>

Upon himself; horrour and doubt distract<br/>

His troubled thoughts, and from the bottom stir<br/>

The Hell within him; for within him Hell<br/>

He brings, and round about him, nor from Hell<br/>

One step, no more than from himself, can fly<br/>

By change of place:  Now conscience wakes despair,<br/>

That slumbered; wakes the bitter memory<br/>

Of what he was, what is, and what must be<br/>

Worse; of worse deeds worse sufferings must ensue.<br/>

Sometimes towards Eden, which now in his view<br/>

Lay pleasant, his grieved look he fixes sad;<br/>

Sometimes towards Heaven, and the full-blazing sun,<br/>

Which now sat high in his meridian tower:<br/>

Then, much revolving, thus in sighs began.<br/>

O thou, that, with surpassing glory crowned,<br/>

Lookest from thy sole dominion like the God<br/>

Of this new world; at whose sight all the stars<br/>

Hide their diminished heads; to thee I call,<br/>

But with no friendly voice, and add thy name,<br/>

Of Sun! to tell thee how I hate thy beams,<br/>

That bring to my remembrance from what state<br/>

I fell, how glorious once above thy sphere;<br/>

Till pride and worse ambition threw me down<br/>

Warring in Heaven against Heaven's matchless King:<br/>

Ah, wherefore! he deserved no such return<br/>

From me, whom he created what I was<br/>

In that bright eminence, and with his good<br/>

Upbraided none; nor was his service hard.<br/>

What could be less than to afford him praise,<br/>

The easiest recompence, and pay him thanks,<br/>

How due! yet all his good proved ill in me,<br/>

And wrought but malice; lifted up so high<br/>

I 'sdeined subjection, and thought one step higher<br/>

Would set me highest, and in a moment quit<br/>

The debt immense of endless gratitude,<br/>

So burdensome still paying, still to owe,<br/>

Forgetful what from him I still received,<br/>

And understood not that a grateful mind<br/>

By owing owes not, but still pays, at once<br/>

Indebted and discharged; what burden then<br/>

O, had his powerful destiny ordained<br/>

Me some inferiour Angel, I had stood<br/>

Then happy; no unbounded hope had raised<br/>

Ambition!  Yet why not some other Power<br/>

As great might have aspired, and me, though mean,<br/>

Drawn to his part; but other Powers as great<br/>

Fell not, but stand unshaken, from within<br/>

Or from without, to all temptations armed.<br/>

Hadst thou the same free will and power to stand?<br/>

Thou hadst: whom hast thou then or what to accuse,<br/>

But Heaven's free love dealt equally to all?<br/>

Be then his love accursed, since love or hate,<br/>

To me alike, it deals eternal woe.<br/>

Nay, cursed be thou; since against his thy will<br/>

Chose freely what it now so justly rues.<br/>

Me miserable! which way shall I fly<br/>

Infinite wrath, and infinite despair?<br/>

Which way I fly is Hell; myself am Hell;<br/>

And, in the lowest deep, a lower deep<br/>

Still threatening to devour me opens wide,<br/>

To which the Hell I suffer seems a Heaven.<br/>

O, then, at last relent:  Is there no place<br/>

Left for repentance, none for pardon left?<br/>

None left but by submission; and that word<br/>

Disdain forbids me, and my dread of shame<br/>

Among the Spirits beneath, whom I seduced<br/>

With other promises and other vaunts<br/>

Than to submit, boasting I could subdue<br/>

The Omnipotent.  Ay me! they little know<br/>

How dearly I abide that boast so vain,<br/>

Under what torments inwardly I groan,<br/>

While they adore me on the throne of Hell.<br/>

With diadem and scepter high advanced,<br/>

The lower still I fall, only supreme<br/>

In misery:  Such joy ambition finds.<br/>

But say I could repent, and could obtain,<br/>

By act of grace, my former state; how soon<br/>

Would highth recall high thoughts, how soon unsay<br/>

What feigned submission swore?  Ease would recant<br/>

Vows made in pain, as violent and void.<br/>

For never can true reconcilement grow,<br/>

Where wounds of deadly hate have pierced so deep:<br/>

Which would but lead me to a worse relapse<br/>

And heavier fall:  so should I purchase dear<br/>

Short intermission bought with double smart.<br/>

This knows my Punisher; therefore as far<br/>

From granting he, as I from begging, peace;<br/>

All hope excluded thus, behold, instead<br/>

Of us out-cast, exil'd, his new delight,<br/>

Mankind created, and for him this world.<br/>

So farewell, hope; and with hope farewell, fear;<br/>

Farewell, remorse! all good to me is lost;<br/>

Evil, be thou my good; by thee at least<br/>

Divided empire with Heaven's King I hold,<br/>

By thee, and more than half perhaps will reign;<br/>

As Man ere long, and this new world, shall know.<br/>

Thus while he spake, each passion dimmed his face<br/>

Thrice changed with pale, ire, envy, and despair;<br/>

Which marred his borrowed visage, and betrayed<br/>

Him counterfeit, if any eye beheld.<br/>

For heavenly minds from such distempers foul<br/>

Are ever clear.  Whereof he soon aware,<br/>

Each perturbation smoothed with outward calm,<br/>

Artificer of fraud; and was the first<br/>

That practised falsehood under saintly show,<br/>

Deep malice to conceal, couched with revenge:<br/>

Yet not enough had practised to deceive<br/>

Uriel once warned; whose eye pursued him down<br/>

The way he went, and on the Assyrian mount<br/>

Saw him disfigured, more than could befall<br/>

Spirit of happy sort; his gestures fierce<br/>

He marked and mad demeanour, then alone,<br/>

As he supposed, all unobserved, unseen.<br/>

So on he fares, and to the border comes<br/>

Of Eden, where delicious Paradise,<br/>

Now nearer, crowns with her enclosure green,<br/>

As with a rural mound, the champaign head<br/>

Of a steep wilderness, whose hairy sides<br/>

With thicket overgrown, grotesque and wild,<br/>

Access denied; and overhead upgrew<br/>

Insuperable height of loftiest shade,<br/>

Cedar, and pine, and fir, and branching palm,<br/>

A sylvan scene, and, as the ranks ascend,<br/>

Shade above shade, a woody theatre<br/>

Of stateliest view.  Yet higher than their tops<br/>

The verdurous wall of Paradise upsprung;<br/>

Which to our general sire gave prospect large<br/>

Into his nether empire neighbouring round.<br/>

And higher than that wall a circling row<br/>

Of goodliest trees, loaden with fairest fruit,<br/>

Blossoms and fruits at once of golden hue,<br/>

Appeared, with gay enamelled colours mixed:<br/>

On which the sun more glad impressed his beams<br/>

Than in fair evening cloud, or humid bow,<br/>

When God hath showered the earth; so lovely seemed<br/>

That landskip:  And of pure now purer air<br/>

Meets his approach, and to the heart inspires<br/>

Vernal delight and joy, able to drive<br/>

All sadness but despair:  Now gentle gales,<br/>

Fanning their odoriferous wings, dispense<br/>

Native perfumes, and whisper whence they stole<br/>

Those balmy spoils.  As when to them who fail<br/>

Beyond the Cape of Hope, and now are past<br/>

Mozambick, off at sea north-east winds blow<br/>

Sabean odours from the spicy shore<br/>

Of Araby the blest; with such delay<br/>

Well pleased they slack their course, and many a league<br/>

Cheered with the grateful smell old Ocean smiles:<br/>

So entertained those odorous sweets the Fiend,<br/>

Who came their bane; though with them better pleased<br/>

Than Asmodeus with the fishy fume<br/>

That drove him, though enamoured, from the spouse<br/>

Of Tobit's son, and with a vengeance sent<br/>

From Media post to Egypt, there fast bound.<br/>

Now to the ascent of that steep savage hill<br/>

Satan had journeyed on, pensive and slow;<br/>

But further way found none, so thick entwined,<br/>

As one continued brake, the undergrowth<br/>

Of shrubs and tangling bushes had perplexed<br/>

All path of man or beast that passed that way.<br/>

One gate there only was, and that looked east<br/>

On the other side: which when the arch-felon saw,<br/>

Due entrance he disdained; and, in contempt,<br/>

At one flight bound high over-leaped all bound<br/>

Of hill or highest wall, and sheer within<br/>

Lights on his feet.  As when a prowling wolf,<br/>

Whom hunger drives to seek new haunt for prey,<br/>

Watching where shepherds pen their flocks at eve<br/>

In hurdled cotes amid the field secure,<br/>

Leaps o'er the fence with ease into the fold:<br/>

Or as a thief, bent to unhoard the cash<br/>

Of some rich burgher, whose substantial doors,<br/>

Cross-barred and bolted fast, fear no assault,<br/>

In at the window climbs, or o'er the tiles:<br/>

So clomb this first grand thief into God's fold;<br/>

So since into his church lewd hirelings climb.<br/>

Thence up he flew, and on the tree of life,<br/>

The middle tree and highest there that grew,<br/>

Sat like a cormorant; yet not true life<br/>

Thereby regained, but sat devising death<br/>

To them who lived; nor on the virtue thought<br/>

Of that life-giving plant, but only used<br/>

For prospect, what well used had been the pledge<br/>

Of immortality.  So little knows<br/>

Any, but God alone, to value right<br/>

The good before him, but perverts best things<br/>

To worst abuse, or to their meanest use.<br/>

Beneath him with new wonder now he views,<br/>

To all delight of human sense exposed,<br/>

In narrow room, Nature's whole wealth, yea more,<br/>

A Heaven on Earth:  For blissful Paradise<br/>

Of God the garden was, by him in the east<br/>

Of Eden planted; Eden stretched her line<br/>

From Auran eastward to the royal towers<br/>

Of great Seleucia, built by Grecian kings,<br/>

Or where the sons of Eden long before<br/>

Dwelt in Telassar:  In this pleasant soil<br/>

His far more pleasant garden God ordained;<br/>

Out of the fertile ground he caused to grow<br/>

All trees of noblest kind for sight, smell, taste;<br/>

And all amid them stood the tree of life,<br/>

High eminent, blooming ambrosial fruit<br/>

Of vegetable gold; and next to life,<br/>

Our death, the tree of knowledge, grew fast by,<br/>

Knowledge of good bought dear by knowing ill.<br/>

Southward through Eden went a river large,<br/>

Nor changed his course, but through the shaggy hill<br/>

Passed underneath ingulfed; for God had thrown<br/>

That mountain as his garden-mould high raised<br/>

Upon the rapid current, which, through veins<br/>

Of porous earth with kindly thirst up-drawn,<br/>

Rose a fresh fountain, and with many a rill<br/>

Watered the garden; thence united fell<br/>

Down the steep glade, and met the nether flood,<br/>

Which from his darksome passage now appears,<br/>

And now, divided into four main streams,<br/>

Runs diverse, wandering many a famous realm<br/>

And country, whereof here needs no account;<br/>

But rather to tell how, if Art could tell,<br/>

How from that sapphire fount the crisped brooks,<br/>

Rolling on orient pearl and sands of gold,<br/>

With mazy errour under pendant shades<br/>

Ran nectar, visiting each plant, and fed<br/>

Flowers worthy of Paradise, which not nice Art<br/>

In beds and curious knots, but Nature boon<br/>

Poured forth profuse on hill, and dale, and plain,<br/>

Both where the morning sun first warmly smote<br/>

The open field, and where the unpierced shade<br/>

Imbrowned the noontide bowers:  Thus was this place<br/>

A happy rural seat of various view;<br/>

Groves whose rich trees wept odorous gums and balm,<br/>

Others whose fruit, burnished with golden rind,<br/>

Hung amiable, Hesperian fables true,<br/>

If true, here only, and of delicious taste:<br/>

Betwixt them lawns, or level downs, and flocks<br/>

Grazing the tender herb, were interposed,<br/>

Or palmy hillock; or the flowery lap<br/>

Of some irriguous valley spread her store,<br/>

Flowers of all hue, and without thorn the rose:<br/>

Another side, umbrageous grots and caves<br/>

Of cool recess, o'er which the mantling vine<br/>

Lays forth her purple grape, and gently creeps<br/>

Luxuriant; mean while murmuring waters fall<br/>

Down the slope hills, dispersed, or in a lake,<br/>

That to the fringed bank with myrtle crowned<br/>

Her crystal mirrour holds, unite their streams.<br/>

The birds their quire apply; airs, vernal airs,<br/>

Breathing the smell of field and grove, attune<br/>

The trembling leaves, while universal Pan,<br/>

Knit with the Graces and the Hours in dance,<br/>

Led on the eternal Spring.  Not that fair field<br/>

Of Enna, where Proserpine gathering flowers,<br/>

Herself a fairer flower by gloomy Dis<br/>

Was gathered, which cost Ceres all that pain<br/>

To seek her through the world; nor that sweet grove<br/>

Of Daphne by Orontes, and the inspired<br/>

Castalian spring, might with this Paradise<br/>

Of Eden strive; nor that Nyseian isle<br/>

Girt with the river Triton, where old Cham,<br/>

Whom Gentiles Ammon call and Libyan Jove,<br/>

Hid Amalthea, and her florid son<br/>

Young Bacchus, from his stepdame Rhea's eye;<br/>

Nor where Abassin kings their issue guard,<br/>

Mount Amara, though this by some supposed<br/>

True Paradise under the Ethiop line<br/>

By Nilus' head, enclosed with shining rock,<br/>

A whole day's journey high, but wide remote<br/>

From this Assyrian garden, where the Fiend<br/>

Saw, undelighted, all delight, all kind<br/>

Of living creatures, new to sight, and strange<br/>

Two of far nobler shape, erect and tall,<br/>

Godlike erect, with native honour clad<br/>

In naked majesty seemed lords of all:<br/>

And worthy seemed; for in their looks divine<br/>

The image of their glorious Maker shone,<br/>

Truth, wisdom, sanctitude severe and pure,<br/>

(Severe, but in true filial freedom placed,)<br/>

Whence true authority in men; though both<br/>

Not equal, as their sex not equal seemed;<br/>

For contemplation he and valour formed;<br/>

For softness she and sweet attractive grace;<br/>

He for God only, she for God in him:<br/>

His fair large front and eye sublime declared<br/>

Absolute rule; and hyacinthine locks<br/>

Round from his parted forelock manly hung<br/>

Clustering, but not beneath his shoulders broad:<br/>

She, as a veil, down to the slender waist<br/>

Her unadorned golden tresses wore<br/>

Dishevelled, but in wanton ringlets waved<br/>

As the vine curls her tendrils, which implied<br/>

Subjection, but required with gentle sway,<br/>

And by her yielded, by him best received,<br/>

Yielded with coy submission, modest pride,<br/>

And sweet, reluctant, amorous delay.<br/>

Nor those mysterious parts were then concealed;<br/>

Then was not guilty shame, dishonest shame<br/>

Of nature's works, honour dishonourable,<br/>

Sin-bred, how have ye troubled all mankind<br/>

With shows instead, mere shows of seeming pure,<br/>

And banished from man's life his happiest life,<br/>

Simplicity and spotless innocence!<br/>

So passed they naked on, nor shunned the sight<br/>

Of God or Angel; for they thought no ill:<br/>

So hand in hand they passed, the loveliest pair,<br/>

That ever since in love's embraces met;<br/>

Adam the goodliest man of men since born<br/>

His sons, the fairest of her daughters Eve.<br/>

Under a tuft of shade that on a green<br/>

Stood whispering soft, by a fresh fountain side<br/>

They sat them down; and, after no more toil<br/>

Of their sweet gardening labour than sufficed<br/>

To recommend cool Zephyr, and made ease<br/>

More easy, wholesome thirst and appetite<br/>

More grateful, to their supper-fruits they fell,<br/>

Nectarine fruits which the compliant boughs<br/>

Yielded them, side-long as they sat recline<br/>

On the soft downy bank damasked with flowers:<br/>

The savoury pulp they chew, and in the rind,<br/>

Still as they thirsted, scoop the brimming stream;<br/>

Nor gentle purpose, nor endearing smiles<br/>

Wanted, nor youthful dalliance, as beseems<br/>

Fair couple, linked in happy nuptial league,<br/>

Alone as they.  About them frisking played<br/>

All beasts of the earth, since wild, and of all chase<br/>

In wood or wilderness, forest or den;<br/>

Sporting the lion ramped, and in his paw<br/>

Dandled the kid; bears, tigers, ounces, pards,<br/>

Gambolled before them; the unwieldy elephant,<br/>

To make them mirth, used all his might, and wreathed<br/>

His lithe proboscis; close the serpent sly,<br/>

Insinuating, wove with Gordian twine<br/>

His braided train, and of his fatal guile<br/>

Gave proof unheeded; others on the grass<br/>

Couched, and now filled with pasture gazing sat,<br/>

Or bedward ruminating; for the sun,<br/>

Declined, was hasting now with prone career<br/>

To the ocean isles, and in the ascending scale<br/>

Of Heaven the stars that usher evening rose:<br/>

When Satan still in gaze, as first he stood,<br/>

Scarce thus at length failed speech recovered sad.<br/>

O Hell! what do mine eyes with grief behold!<br/>

Into our room of bliss thus high advanced<br/>

Creatures of other mould, earth-born perhaps,<br/>

Not Spirits, yet to heavenly Spirits bright<br/>

Little inferiour; whom my thoughts pursue<br/>

With wonder, and could love, so lively shines<br/>

In them divine resemblance, and such grace<br/>

The hand that formed them on their shape hath poured.<br/>

Ah! gentle pair, ye little think how nigh<br/>

Your change approaches, when all these delights<br/>

Will vanish, and deliver ye to woe;<br/>

More woe, the more your taste is now of joy;<br/>

Happy, but for so happy ill secured<br/>

Long to continue, and this high seat your Heaven<br/>

Ill fenced for Heaven to keep out such a foe<br/>

As now is entered; yet no purposed foe<br/>

To you, whom I could pity thus forlorn,<br/>

Though I unpitied:  League with you I seek,<br/>

And mutual amity, so strait, so close,<br/>

That I with you must dwell, or you with me<br/>

Henceforth; my dwelling haply may not please,<br/>

Like this fair Paradise, your sense; yet such<br/>

Accept your Maker's work; he gave it me,<br/>

Which I as freely give:  Hell shall unfold,<br/>

To entertain you two, her widest gates,<br/>

And send forth all her kings; there will be room,<br/>

Not like these narrow limits, to receive<br/>

Your numerous offspring; if no better place,<br/>

Thank him who puts me loth to this revenge<br/>

On you who wrong me not for him who wronged.<br/>

And should I at your harmless innocence<br/>

Melt, as I do, yet publick reason just,<br/>

Honour and empire with revenge enlarged,<br/>

By conquering this new world, compels me now<br/>

To do what else, though damned, I should abhor.<br/>

So spake the Fiend, and with necessity,<br/>

The tyrant's plea, excused his devilish deeds.<br/>

Then from his lofty stand on that high tree<br/>

Down he alights among the sportful herd<br/>

Of those four-footed kinds, himself now one,<br/>

Now other, as their shape served best his end<br/>

Nearer to view his prey, and, unespied,<br/>

To mark what of their state he more might learn,<br/>

By word or action marked.  About them round<br/>

A lion now he stalks with fiery glare;<br/>

Then as a tiger, who by chance hath spied<br/>

In some purlieu two gentle fawns at play,<br/>

Straight couches close, then, rising, changes oft<br/>

His couchant watch, as one who chose his ground,<br/>

Whence rushing, he might surest seize them both,<br/>

Griped in each paw: when, Adam first of men<br/>

To first of women Eve thus moving speech,<br/>

Turned him, all ear to hear new utterance flow.<br/>

Sole partner, and sole part, of all these joys,<br/>

Dearer thyself than all; needs must the Power<br/>

That made us, and for us this ample world,<br/>

Be infinitely good, and of his good<br/>

As liberal and free as infinite;<br/>

That raised us from the dust, and placed us here<br/>

In all this happiness, who at his hand<br/>

Have nothing merited, nor can perform<br/>

Aught whereof he hath need; he who requires<br/>

From us no other service than to keep<br/>

This one, this easy charge, of all the trees<br/>

In Paradise that bear delicious fruit<br/>

So various, not to taste that only tree<br/>

Of knowledge, planted by the tree of life;<br/>

So near grows death to life, whate'er death is,<br/>

Some dreadful thing no doubt; for well thou knowest<br/>

God hath pronounced it death to taste that tree,<br/>

The only sign of our obedience left,<br/>

Among so many signs of power and rule<br/>

Conferred upon us, and dominion given<br/>

Over all other creatures that possess<br/>

Earth, air, and sea.  Then let us not think hard<br/>

One easy prohibition, who enjoy<br/>

Free leave so large to all things else, and choice<br/>

Unlimited of manifold delights:<br/>

But let us ever praise him, and extol<br/>

His bounty, following our delightful task,<br/>

To prune these growing plants, and tend these flowers,<br/>

Which were it toilsome, yet with thee were sweet.<br/>

To whom thus Eve replied.  O thou for whom<br/>

And from whom I was formed, flesh of thy flesh,<br/>

And without whom am to no end, my guide<br/>

And head! what thou hast said is just and right.<br/>

For we to him indeed all praises owe,<br/>

And daily thanks; I chiefly, who enjoy<br/>

So far the happier lot, enjoying thee<br/>

Pre-eminent by so much odds, while thou<br/>

Like consort to thyself canst no where find.<br/>

That day I oft remember, when from sleep<br/>

I first awaked, and found myself reposed<br/>

Under a shade on flowers, much wondering where<br/>

And what I was, whence thither brought, and how.<br/>

Not distant far from thence a murmuring sound<br/>

Of waters issued from a cave, and spread<br/>

Into a liquid plain, then stood unmoved<br/>

Pure as the expanse of Heaven; I thither went<br/>

With unexperienced thought, and laid me down<br/>

On the green bank, to look into the clear<br/>

Smooth lake, that to me seemed another sky.<br/>

As I bent down to look, just opposite<br/>

A shape within the watery gleam appeared,<br/>

Bending to look on me:  I started back,<br/>

It started back; but pleased I soon returned,<br/>

Pleased it returned as soon with answering looks<br/>

Of sympathy and love:  There I had fixed<br/>

Mine eyes till now, and pined with vain desire,<br/>

Had not a voice thus warned me;  "What thou seest,<br/>

What there thou seest, fair Creature, is thyself;<br/>

With thee it came and goes: but follow me,<br/>

And I will bring thee where no shadow stays<br/>

Thy coming, and thy soft embraces, he<br/>

Whose image thou art; him thou shalt enjoy<br/>

Inseparably thine, to him shalt bear<br/>

Multitudes like thyself, and thence be called<br/>

Mother of human race."  What could I do,<br/>

But follow straight, invisibly thus led?<br/>

Till I espied thee, fair indeed and tall,<br/>

Under a platane; yet methought less fair,<br/>

Less winning soft, less amiably mild,<br/>

Than that smooth watery image:  Back I turned;<br/>

Thou following cryedst aloud, "Return, fair Eve;<br/>

Whom flyest thou?  whom thou flyest, of him thou art,<br/>

His flesh, his bone; to give thee being I lent<br/>

Out of my side to thee, nearest my heart,<br/>

Substantial life, to have thee by my side<br/>

Henceforth an individual solace dear;<br/>

Part of my soul I seek thee, and thee claim<br/>

My other half:"  With that thy gentle hand<br/>

Seised mine: I yielded; and from that time see<br/>

How beauty is excelled by manly grace,<br/>

And wisdom, which alone is truly fair.<br/>

So spake our general mother, and with eyes<br/>

Of conjugal attraction unreproved,<br/>

And meek surrender, half-embracing leaned<br/>

On our first father; half her swelling breast<br/>

Naked met his, under the flowing gold<br/>

Of her loose tresses hid: he in delight<br/>

Both of her beauty, and submissive charms,<br/>

Smiled with superiour love, as Jupiter<br/>

On Juno smiles, when he impregns the clouds<br/>

That shed Mayflowers; and pressed her matron lip<br/>

With kisses pure:  Aside the Devil turned<br/>

For envy; yet with jealous leer malign<br/>

Eyed them askance, and to himself thus plained.<br/>

Sight hateful, sight tormenting! thus these two,<br/>

Imparadised in one another's arms,<br/>

The happier Eden, shall enjoy their fill<br/>

Of bliss on bliss; while I to Hell am thrust,<br/>

Where neither joy nor love, but fierce desire,<br/>

Among our other torments not the least,<br/>

Still unfulfilled with pain of longing pines.<br/>

Yet let me not forget what I have gained<br/>

From their own mouths:  All is not theirs, it seems;<br/>

One fatal tree there stands, of knowledge called,<br/>

Forbidden them to taste:  Knowledge forbidden<br/>

Suspicious, reasonless.  Why should their Lord<br/>

Envy them that?  Can it be sin to know?<br/>

Can it be death?  And do they only stand<br/>

By ignorance?  Is that their happy state,<br/>

The proof of their obedience and their faith?<br/>

O fair foundation laid whereon to build<br/>

Their ruin! hence I will excite their minds<br/>

With more desire to know, and to reject<br/>

Envious commands, invented with design<br/>

To keep them low, whom knowledge might exalt<br/>

Equal with Gods: aspiring to be such,<br/>

They taste and die:  What likelier can ensue<br/>

But first with narrow search I must walk round<br/>

This garden, and no corner leave unspied;<br/>

A chance but chance may lead where I may meet<br/>

Some wandering Spirit of Heaven by fountain side,<br/>

Or in thick shade retired, from him to draw<br/>

What further would be learned.  Live while ye may,<br/>

Yet happy pair; enjoy, till I return,<br/>

Short pleasures, for long woes are to succeed!<br/>

So saying, his proud step he scornful turned,<br/>

But with sly circumspection, and began<br/>

Through wood, through waste, o'er hill, o'er dale, his roam<br/>

Mean while in utmost longitude, where Heaven<br/>

With earth and ocean meets, the setting sun<br/>

Slowly descended, and with right aspect<br/>

Against the eastern gate of Paradise<br/>

Levelled his evening rays:  It was a rock<br/>

Of alabaster, piled up to the clouds,<br/>

Conspicuous far, winding with one ascent<br/>

Accessible from earth, one entrance high;<br/>

The rest was craggy cliff, that overhung<br/>

Still as it rose, impossible to climb.<br/>

Betwixt these rocky pillars Gabriel sat,<br/>

Chief of the angelick guards, awaiting night;<br/>

About him exercised heroick games<br/>

The unarmed youth of Heaven, but nigh at hand<br/>

Celestial armoury, shields, helms, and spears,<br/>

Hung high with diamond flaming, and with gold.<br/>

Thither came Uriel, gliding through the even<br/>

On a sun-beam, swift as a shooting star<br/>

In autumn thwarts the night, when vapours fired<br/>

Impress the air, and shows the mariner<br/>

From what point of his compass to beware<br/>

Impetuous winds:  He thus began in haste.<br/>

Gabriel, to thee thy course by lot hath given<br/>

Charge and strict watch, that to this happy place<br/>

No evil thing approach or enter in.<br/>

This day at highth of noon came to my sphere<br/>

A Spirit, zealous, as he seemed, to know<br/>

More of the Almighty's works, and chiefly Man,<br/>

God's latest image:  I described his way<br/>

Bent all on speed, and marked his aery gait;<br/>

But in the mount that lies from Eden north,<br/>

Where he first lighted, soon discerned his looks<br/>

Alien from Heaven, with passions foul obscured:<br/>

Mine eye pursued him still, but under shade<br/>

Lost sight of him:  One of the banished crew,<br/>

I fear, hath ventured from the deep, to raise<br/>

New troubles; him thy care must be to find.<br/>

To whom the winged warriour thus returned.<br/>

Uriel, no wonder if thy perfect sight,<br/>

Amid the sun's bright circle where thou sitst,<br/>

See far and wide:  In at this gate none pass<br/>

The vigilance here placed, but such as come<br/>

Well known from Heaven; and since meridian hour<br/>

No creature thence:  If Spirit of other sort,<br/>

So minded, have o'er-leaped these earthly bounds<br/>

On purpose, hard thou knowest it to exclude<br/>

Spiritual substance with corporeal bar.<br/>

But if within the circuit of these walks,<br/>

In whatsoever shape he lurk, of whom<br/>

Thou tellest, by morrow dawning I shall know.<br/>

So promised he; and Uriel to his charge<br/>

Returned on that bright beam, whose point now raised<br/>

Bore him slope downward to the sun now fallen<br/>

Beneath the Azores; whether the prime orb,<br/>

Incredible how swift, had thither rolled<br/>

Diurnal, or this less volubil earth,<br/>

By shorter flight to the east, had left him there<br/>

Arraying with reflected purple and gold<br/>

The clouds that on his western throne attend.<br/>

Now came still Evening on, and Twilight gray<br/>

Had in her sober livery all things clad;<br/>

Silence accompanied; for beast and bird,<br/>

They to their grassy couch, these to their nests<br/>

Were slunk, all but the wakeful nightingale;<br/>

She all night long her amorous descant sung;<br/>

Silence was pleased:  Now glowed the firmament<br/>

With living sapphires:  Hesperus, that led<br/>

The starry host, rode brightest, till the moon,<br/>

Rising in clouded majesty, at length<br/>

Apparent queen unveiled her peerless light,<br/>

And o'er the dark her silver mantle threw.<br/>

When Adam thus to Eve.  Fair Consort, the hour<br/>

Of night, and all things now retired to rest,<br/>

Mind us of like repose; since God hath set<br/>

Labour and rest, as day and night, to men<br/>

Successive; and the timely dew of sleep,<br/>

Now falling with soft slumbrous weight, inclines<br/>

Our eye-lids:  Other creatures all day long<br/>

Rove idle, unemployed, and less need rest;<br/>

Man hath his daily work of body or mind<br/>

Appointed, which declares his dignity,<br/>

And the regard of Heaven on all his ways;<br/>

While other animals unactive range,<br/>

And of their doings God takes no account.<br/>

To-morrow, ere fresh morning streak the east<br/>

With first approach of light, we must be risen,<br/>

And at our pleasant labour, to reform<br/>

Yon flowery arbours, yonder alleys green,<br/>

Our walk at noon, with branches overgrown,<br/>

That mock our scant manuring, and require<br/>

More hands than ours to lop their wanton growth:<br/>

Those blossoms also, and those dropping gums,<br/>

That lie bestrown, unsightly and unsmooth,<br/>

Ask riddance, if we mean to tread with ease;<br/>

Mean while, as Nature wills, night bids us rest.<br/>

To whom thus Eve, with perfect beauty adorned<br/>

My Author and Disposer, what thou bidst<br/>

Unargued I obey:  So God ordains;<br/>

God is thy law, thou mine:  To know no more<br/>

Is woman's happiest knowledge, and her praise.<br/>

With thee conversing I forget all time;<br/>

All seasons, and their change, all please alike.<br/>

Sweet is the breath of Morn, her rising sweet,<br/>

With charm of earliest birds:  pleasant the sun,<br/>

When first on this delightful land he spreads<br/>

His orient beams, on herb, tree, fruit, and flower,<br/>

Glistering with dew; fragrant the fertile earth<br/>

After soft showers; and sweet the coming on<br/>

Of grateful Evening mild; then silent Night,<br/>

With this her solemn bird, and this fair moon,<br/>

And these the gems of Heaven, her starry train:<br/>

But neither breath of Morn, when she ascends<br/>

With charm of earliest birds; nor rising sun<br/>

On this delightful land; nor herb, fruit, flower,<br/>

Glistering with dew; nor fragrance after showers;<br/>

Nor grateful Evening mild; nor silent Night,<br/>

With this her solemn bird, nor walk by moon,<br/>

Or glittering star-light, without thee is sweet.<br/>

But wherefore all night long shine these? for whom<br/>

This glorious sight, when sleep hath shut all eyes?<br/>

To whom our general ancestor replied.<br/>

Daughter of God and Man, accomplished Eve,<br/>

These have their course to finish round the earth,<br/>

By morrow evening, and from land to land<br/>

In order, though to nations yet unborn,<br/>

Ministring light prepared, they set and rise;<br/>

Lest total Darkness should by night regain<br/>

Her old possession, and extinguish life<br/>

In Nature and all things; which these soft fires<br/>

Not only enlighten, but with kindly heat<br/>

Of various influence foment and warm,<br/>

Temper or nourish, or in part shed down<br/>

Their stellar virtue on all kinds that grow<br/>

On earth, made hereby apter to receive<br/>

Perfection from the sun's more potent ray.<br/>

These then, though unbeheld in deep of night,<br/>

Shine not in vain; nor think, though men were none,<br/>

That Heaven would want spectators, God want praise:<br/>

Millions of spiritual creatures walk the earth<br/>

Unseen, both when we wake, and when we sleep:<br/>

All these with ceaseless praise his works behold<br/>

Both day and night:  How often from the steep<br/>

Of echoing hill or thicket have we heard<br/>

Celestial voices to the midnight air,<br/>

Sole, or responsive each to others note,<br/>

Singing their great Creator? oft in bands<br/>

While they keep watch, or nightly rounding walk,<br/>

With heavenly touch of instrumental sounds<br/>

In full harmonick number joined, their songs<br/>

Divide the night, and lift our thoughts to Heaven.<br/>

Thus talking, hand in hand alone they passed<br/>

On to their blissful bower: it was a place<br/>

Chosen by the sovran Planter, when he framed<br/>

All things to Man's delightful use; the roof<br/>

Of thickest covert was inwoven shade<br/>

Laurel and myrtle, and what higher grew<br/>

Of firm and fragrant leaf; on either side<br/>

Acanthus, and each odorous bushy shrub,<br/>

Fenced up the verdant wall; each beauteous flower,<br/>

Iris all hues, roses, and jessamin,<br/>

Reared high their flourished heads between, and wrought<br/>

Mosaick; underfoot the violet,<br/>

Crocus, and hyacinth, with rich inlay<br/>

Broidered the ground, more coloured than with stone<br/>

Of costliest emblem:  Other creature here,<br/>

Bird, beast, insect, or worm, durst enter none,<br/>

Such was their awe of Man.  In shadier bower<br/>

More sacred and sequestered, though but feigned,<br/>

Pan or Sylvanus never slept, nor Nymph<br/>

Nor Faunus haunted.  Here, in close recess,<br/>

With flowers, garlands, and sweet-smelling herbs,<br/>

Espoused Eve decked first her nuptial bed;<br/>

And heavenly quires the hymenaean sung,<br/>

What day the genial Angel to our sire<br/>

Brought her in naked beauty more adorned,<br/>

More lovely, than Pandora, whom the Gods<br/>

Endowed with all their gifts, and O! too like<br/>

In sad event, when to the unwiser son<br/>

Of Japhet brought by Hermes, she ensnared<br/>

Mankind with her fair looks, to be avenged<br/>

On him who had stole Jove's authentick fire.<br/>

Thus, at their shady lodge arrived, both stood,<br/>

Both turned, and under open sky adored<br/>

The God that made both sky, air, earth, and heaven,<br/>

Which they beheld, the moon's resplendent globe,<br/>

And starry pole:  Thou also madest the night,<br/>

Maker Omnipotent, and thou the day,<br/>

Which we, in our appointed work employed,<br/>

Have finished, happy in our mutual help<br/>

And mutual love, the crown of all our bliss<br/>

Ordained by thee; and this delicious place<br/>

For us too large, where thy abundance wants<br/>

Partakers, and uncropt falls to the ground.<br/>

But thou hast promised from us two a race<br/>

To fill the earth, who shall with us extol<br/>

Thy goodness infinite, both when we wake,<br/>

And when we seek, as now, thy gift of sleep.<br/>

This said unanimous, and other rites<br/>

Observing none, but adoration pure<br/>

Which God likes best, into their inmost bower<br/>

Handed they went; and, eased the putting off<br/>

These troublesome disguises which we wear,<br/>

Straight side by side were laid; nor turned, I ween,<br/>

Adam from his fair spouse, nor Eve the rites<br/>

Mysterious of connubial love refused:<br/>

Whatever hypocrites austerely talk<br/>

Of purity, and place, and innocence,<br/>

Defaming as impure what God declares<br/>

Pure, and commands to some, leaves free to all.<br/>

Our Maker bids encrease; who bids abstain<br/>

But our Destroyer, foe to God and Man?<br/>

Hail, wedded Love, mysterious law, true source<br/>

Of human offspring, sole propriety<br/>

In Paradise of all things common else!<br/>

By thee adulterous Lust was driven from men<br/>

Among the bestial herds to range; by thee<br/>

Founded in reason, loyal, just, and pure,<br/>

Relations dear, and all the charities<br/>

Of father, son, and brother, first were known.<br/>

Far be it, that I should write thee sin or blame,<br/>

Or think thee unbefitting holiest place,<br/>

Perpetual fountain of domestick sweets,<br/>

Whose bed is undefiled and chaste pronounced,<br/>

Present, or past, as saints and patriarchs used.<br/>

Here Love his golden shafts employs, here lights<br/>

His constant lamp, and waves his purple wings,<br/>

Reigns here and revels; not in the bought smile<br/>

Of harlots, loveless, joyless, unendeared,<br/>

Casual fruition; nor in court-amours,<br/>

Mixed dance, or wanton mask, or midnight ball,<br/>

Or serenate, which the starved lover sings<br/>

To his proud fair, best quitted with disdain.<br/>

These, lulled by nightingales, embracing slept,<br/>

And on their naked limbs the flowery roof<br/>

Showered roses, which the morn repaired.  Sleep on,<br/>

Blest pair; and O! yet happiest, if ye seek<br/>

No happier state, and know to know no more.<br/>

Now had night measured with her shadowy cone<br/>

Half way up hill this vast sublunar vault,<br/>

And from their ivory port the Cherubim,<br/>

Forth issuing at the accustomed hour, stood armed<br/>

To their night watches in warlike parade;<br/>

When Gabriel to his next in power thus spake.<br/>

Uzziel, half these draw off, and coast the south<br/>

With strictest watch; these other wheel the north;<br/>

Our circuit meets full west.  As flame they part,<br/>

Half wheeling to the shield, half to the spear.<br/>

From these, two strong and subtle Spirits he called<br/>

That near him stood, and gave them thus in charge.<br/>

Ithuriel and Zephon, with winged speed<br/>

Search through this garden, leave unsearched no nook;<br/>

But chiefly where those two fair creatures lodge,<br/>

Now laid perhaps asleep, secure of harm.<br/>

This evening from the sun's decline arrived,<br/>

Who tells of some infernal Spirit seen<br/>

Hitherward bent (who could have thought?) escaped<br/>

The bars of Hell, on errand bad no doubt:<br/>

Such, where ye find, seise fast, and hither bring.<br/>

So saying, on he led his radiant files,<br/>

Dazzling the moon; these to the bower direct<br/>

In search of whom they sought:  Him there they found<br/>

Squat like a toad, close at the ear of Eve,<br/>

Assaying by his devilish art to reach<br/>

The organs of her fancy, and with them forge<br/>

Illusions, as he list, phantasms and dreams;<br/>

Or if, inspiring venom, he might taint<br/>

The animal spirits, that from pure blood arise<br/>

Like gentle breaths from rivers pure, thence raise<br/>

At least distempered, discontented thoughts,<br/>

Vain hopes, vain aims, inordinate desires,<br/>

Blown up with high conceits ingendering pride.<br/>

Him thus intent Ithuriel with his spear<br/>

Touched lightly; for no falshood can endure<br/>

Touch of celestial temper, but returns<br/>

Of force to its own likeness:  Up he starts<br/>

Discovered and surprised.  As when a spark<br/>

Lights on a heap of nitrous powder, laid<br/>

Fit for the tun some magazine to store<br/>

Against a rumoured war, the smutty grain,<br/>

With sudden blaze diffused, inflames the air;<br/>

So started up in his own shape the Fiend.<br/>

Back stept those two fair Angels, half amazed<br/>

So sudden to behold the grisly king;<br/>

Yet thus, unmoved with fear, accost him soon.<br/>

Which of those rebel Spirits adjudged to Hell<br/>

Comest thou, escaped thy prison? and, transformed,<br/>

Why sat'st thou like an enemy in wait,<br/>

Here watching at the head of these that sleep?<br/>

Know ye not then said Satan, filled with scorn,<br/>

Know ye not me? ye knew me once no mate<br/>

For you, there sitting where ye durst not soar:<br/>

Not to know me argues yourselves unknown,<br/>

The lowest of your throng; or, if ye know,<br/>

Why ask ye, and superfluous begin<br/>

Your message, like to end as much in vain?<br/>

To whom thus Zephon, answering scorn with scorn.<br/>

Think not, revolted Spirit, thy shape the same,<br/>

Or undiminished brightness to be known,<br/>

As when thou stoodest in Heaven upright and pure;<br/>

That glory then, when thou no more wast good,<br/>

Departed from thee; and thou resemblest now<br/>

Thy sin and place of doom obscure and foul.<br/>

But come, for thou, be sure, shalt give account<br/>

To him who sent us, whose charge is to keep<br/>

This place inviolable, and these from harm.<br/>

So spake the Cherub; and his grave rebuke,<br/>

Severe in youthful beauty, added grace<br/>

Invincible:  Abashed the Devil stood,<br/>

And felt how awful goodness is, and saw<br/>

Virtue in her shape how lovely; saw, and pined<br/>

His loss; but chiefly to find here observed<br/>

His lustre visibly impaired; yet seemed<br/>

Undaunted.  If I must contend, said he,<br/>

Best with the best, the sender, not the sent,<br/>

Or all at once; more glory will be won,<br/>

Or less be lost.  Thy fear, said Zephon bold,<br/>

Will save us trial what the least can do<br/>

Single against thee wicked, and thence weak.<br/>

The Fiend replied not, overcome with rage;<br/>

But, like a proud steed reined, went haughty on,<br/>

Champing his iron curb:  To strive or fly<br/>

He held it vain; awe from above had quelled<br/>

His heart, not else dismayed.  Now drew they nigh<br/>

The western point, where those half-rounding guards<br/>

Just met, and closing stood in squadron joined,<br/>

A waiting next command.  To whom their Chief,<br/>

Gabriel, from the front thus called aloud.<br/>

O friends!  I hear the tread of nimble feet<br/>

Hasting this way, and now by glimpse discern<br/>

Ithuriel and Zephon through the shade;<br/>

And with them comes a third of regal port,<br/>

But faded splendour wan; who by his gait<br/>

And fierce demeanour seems the Prince of Hell,<br/>

Not likely to part hence without contest;<br/>

Stand firm, for in his look defiance lours.<br/>

He scarce had ended, when those two approached,<br/>

And brief related whom they brought, where found,<br/>

How busied, in what form and posture couched.<br/>

To whom with stern regard thus Gabriel spake.<br/>

Why hast thou, Satan, broke the bounds prescribed<br/>

To thy transgressions, and disturbed the charge<br/>

Of others, who approve not to transgress<br/>

By thy example, but have power and right<br/>

To question thy bold entrance on this place;<br/>

Employed, it seems, to violate sleep, and those<br/>

Whose dwelling God hath planted here in bliss!<br/>

To whom thus Satan with contemptuous brow.<br/>

Gabriel? thou hadst in Heaven the esteem of wise,<br/>

And such I held thee; but this question asked<br/>

Puts me in doubt.  Lives there who loves his pain!<br/>

Who would not, finding way, break loose from Hell,<br/>

Though thither doomed!  Thou wouldst thyself, no doubt<br/>

And boldly venture to whatever place<br/>

Farthest from pain, where thou mightst hope to change<br/>

Torment with ease, and soonest recompense<br/>

Dole with delight, which in this place I sought;<br/>

To thee no reason, who knowest only good,<br/>

But evil hast not tried: and wilt object<br/>

His will who bounds us!  Let him surer bar<br/>

His iron gates, if he intends our stay<br/>

In that dark durance:  Thus much what was asked.<br/>

The rest is true, they found me where they say;<br/>

But that implies not violence or harm.<br/>

Thus he in scorn.  The warlike Angel moved,<br/>

Disdainfully half smiling, thus replied.<br/>

O loss of one in Heaven to judge of wise<br/>

Since Satan fell, whom folly overthrew,<br/>

And now returns him from his prison 'scaped,<br/>

Gravely in doubt whether to hold them wise<br/>

Or not, who ask what boldness brought him hither<br/>

Unlicensed from his bounds in Hell prescribed;<br/>

So wise he judges it to fly from pain<br/>

However, and to 'scape his punishment!<br/>

So judge thou still, presumptuous! till the wrath,<br/>

Which thou incurrest by flying, meet thy flight<br/>

Sevenfold, and scourge that wisdom back to Hell,<br/>

Which taught thee yet no better, that no pain<br/>

Can equal anger infinite provoked.<br/>

But wherefore thou alone? wherefore with thee<br/>

Came not all hell broke loose? or thou than they<br/>

Less hardy to endure?  Courageous Chief!<br/>

The first in flight from pain! hadst thou alleged<br/>

To thy deserted host this cause of flight,<br/>

Thou surely hadst not come sole fugitive.<br/>

To which the Fiend thus answered, frowning stern.<br/>

Not that I less endure, or shrink from pain,<br/>

Insulting Angel! well thou knowest I stood<br/>

Thy fiercest, when in battle to thy aid<br/>

The blasting vollied thunder made all speed,<br/>

And seconded thy else not dreaded spear.<br/>

But still thy words at random, as before,<br/>

Argue thy inexperience what behoves<br/>

From hard assays and ill successes past<br/>

A faithful leader, not to hazard all<br/>

Through ways of danger by himself untried:<br/>

I, therefore, I alone first undertook<br/>

To wing the desolate abyss, and spy<br/>

This new created world, whereof in Hell<br/>

Fame is not silent, here in hope to find<br/>

Better abode, and my afflicted Powers<br/>

To settle here on earth, or in mid air;<br/>

Though for possession put to try once more<br/>

What thou and thy gay legions dare against;<br/>

Whose easier business were to serve their Lord<br/>

High up in Heaven, with songs to hymn his throne,<br/>

And practised distances to cringe, not fight,<br/>

To whom the warriour Angel soon replied.<br/>

To say and straight unsay, pretending first<br/>

Wise to fly pain, professing next the spy,<br/>

Argues no leader but a liar traced,<br/>

Satan, and couldst thou faithful add?  O name,<br/>

O sacred name of faithfulness profaned!<br/>

Faithful to whom? to thy rebellious crew?<br/>

Army of Fiends, fit body to fit head.<br/>

Was this your discipline and faith engaged,<br/>

Your military obedience, to dissolve<br/>

Allegiance to the acknowledged Power supreme?<br/>

And thou, sly hypocrite, who now wouldst seem<br/>

Patron of liberty, who more than thou<br/>

Once fawned, and cringed, and servilely adored<br/>

Heaven's awful Monarch? wherefore, but in hope<br/>

To dispossess him, and thyself to reign?<br/>

But mark what I arreed thee now, Avant;<br/>

Fly neither whence thou fledst!  If from this hour<br/>

Within these hallowed limits thou appear,<br/>

Back to the infernal pit I drag thee chained,<br/>

And seal thee so, as henceforth not to scorn<br/>

The facile gates of Hell too slightly barred.<br/>

So threatened he; but Satan to no threats<br/>

Gave heed, but waxing more in rage replied.<br/>

Then when I am thy captive talk of chains,<br/>

Proud limitary Cherub! but ere then<br/>

Far heavier load thyself expect to feel<br/>

From my prevailing arm, though Heaven's King<br/>

Ride on thy wings, and thou with thy compeers,<br/>

Us'd to the yoke, drawest his triumphant wheels<br/>

In progress through the road of Heaven star-paved.<br/>

While thus he spake, the angelick squadron bright<br/>

Turned fiery red, sharpening in mooned horns<br/>

Their phalanx, and began to hem him round<br/>

With ported spears, as thick as when a field<br/>

Of Ceres ripe for harvest waving bends<br/>

Her bearded grove of ears, which way the wind<br/>

Sways them; the careful plowman doubting stands,<br/>

Left on the threshing floor his hopeless sheaves<br/>

Prove chaff.  On the other side, Satan, alarmed,<br/>

Collecting all his might, dilated stood,<br/>

Like Teneriff or Atlas, unremoved:<br/>

His stature reached the sky, and on his crest<br/>

Sat Horrour plumed; nor wanted in his grasp<br/>

What seemed both spear and shield:  Now dreadful deeds<br/>

Might have ensued, nor only Paradise<br/>

In this commotion, but the starry cope<br/>

Of Heaven perhaps, or all the elements<br/>

At least had gone to wrack, disturbed and torn<br/>

With violence of this conflict, had not soon<br/>

The Eternal, to prevent such horrid fray,<br/>

Hung forth in Heaven his golden scales, yet seen<br/>

Betwixt Astrea and the Scorpion sign,<br/>

Wherein all things created first he weighed,<br/>

The pendulous round earth with balanced air<br/>

In counterpoise, now ponders all events,<br/>

Battles and realms:  In these he put two weights,<br/>

The sequel each of parting and of fight:<br/>

The latter quick up flew, and kicked the beam,<br/>

Which Gabriel spying, thus bespake the Fiend.<br/>

Satan, I know thy strength, and thou knowest mine;<br/>

Neither our own, but given:  What folly then<br/>

To boast what arms can do? since thine no more<br/>

Than Heaven permits, nor mine, though doubled now<br/>

To trample thee as mire:  For proof look up,<br/>

And read thy lot in yon celestial sign;<br/>

Where thou art weighed, and shown how light, how weak,<br/>

If thou resist.  The Fiend looked up, and knew<br/>

His mounted scale aloft:  Nor more; but fled<br/>

Murmuring, and with him fled the shades of night.<br/>

<h3 id="id00024" style="margin-top: 3em">Book V</h3>
<p id="id00025" style="margin-top: 2em">Now Morn, her rosy steps in the eastern clime<br/>

Advancing, sowed the earth with orient pearl,<br/>

When Adam waked, so customed; for his sleep<br/>

Was aery-light, from pure digestion bred,<br/>

And temperate vapours bland, which the only sound<br/>

Of leaves and fuming rills, Aurora's fan,<br/>

Lightly dispersed, and the shrill matin song<br/>

Of birds on every bough; so much the more<br/>

His wonder was to find unwakened Eve<br/>

With tresses discomposed, and glowing cheek,<br/>

As through unquiet rest:  He, on his side<br/>

Leaning half raised, with looks of cordial love<br/>

Hung over her enamoured, and beheld<br/>

Beauty, which, whether waking or asleep,<br/>

Shot forth peculiar graces; then with voice<br/>

Mild, as when Zephyrus on Flora breathes,<br/>

Her hand soft touching, whispered thus.  Awake,<br/>

My fairest, my espoused, my latest found,<br/>

Heaven's last best gift, my ever new delight!<br/>

Awake:  The morning shines, and the fresh field<br/>

Calls us; we lose the prime, to mark how spring<br/>

Our tender plants, how blows the citron grove,<br/>

What drops the myrrh, and what the balmy reed,<br/>

How nature paints her colours, how the bee<br/>

Sits on the bloom extracting liquid sweet.<br/>

Such whispering waked her, but with startled eye<br/>

On Adam, whom embracing, thus she spake.<br/>

O sole in whom my thoughts find all repose,<br/>

My glory, my perfection! glad I see<br/>

Thy face, and morn returned; for I this night<br/>

(Such night till this I never passed) have dreamed,<br/>

If dreamed, not, as I oft am wont, of thee,<br/>

Works of day past, or morrow's next design,<br/>

But of offence and trouble, which my mind<br/>

Knew never till this irksome night:  Methought,<br/>

Close at mine ear one called me forth to walk<br/>

With gentle voice;  I thought it thine: It said,<br/>

"Why sleepest thou, Eve? now is the pleasant time,<br/>

The cool, the silent, save where silence yields<br/>

To the night-warbling bird, that now awake<br/>

Tunes sweetest his love-laboured song; now reigns<br/>

Full-orbed the moon, and with more pleasing light<br/>

Shadowy sets off the face of things; in vain,<br/>

If none regard; Heaven wakes with all his eyes,<br/>

Whom to behold but thee, Nature's desire?<br/>

In whose sight all things joy, with ravishment<br/>

Attracted by thy beauty still to gaze."<br/>

I rose as at thy call, but found thee not;<br/>

To find thee I directed then my walk;<br/>

And on, methought, alone I passed through ways<br/>

That brought me on a sudden to the tree<br/>

Of interdicted knowledge: fair it seemed,<br/>

Much fairer to my fancy than by day:<br/>

And, as I wondering looked, beside it stood<br/>

One shaped and winged like one of those from Heaven<br/>

By us oft seen; his dewy locks distilled<br/>

Ambrosia; on that tree he also gazed;<br/>

And "O fair plant," said he, "with fruit surcharged,<br/>

Deigns none to ease thy load, and taste thy sweet,<br/>

Nor God, nor Man?  Is knowledge so despised?<br/>

Or envy, or what reserve forbids to taste?<br/>

Forbid who will, none shall from me withhold<br/>

Longer thy offered good; why else set here?"<br/>

This said, he paused not, but with venturous arm<br/>

He plucked, he tasted; me damp horrour chilled<br/>

At such bold words vouched with a deed so bold:<br/>

But he thus, overjoyed; "O fruit divine,<br/>

Sweet of thyself, but much more sweet thus cropt,<br/>

Forbidden here, it seems, as only fit<br/>

For Gods, yet able to make Gods of Men:<br/>

And why not Gods of Men; since good, the more<br/>

Communicated, more abundant grows,<br/>

The author not impaired, but honoured more?<br/>

Here, happy creature, fair angelick Eve!<br/>

Partake thou also; happy though thou art,<br/>

Happier thou mayest be, worthier canst not be:<br/>

Taste this, and be henceforth among the Gods<br/>

Thyself a Goddess, not to earth confined,<br/>

But sometimes in the air, as we, sometimes<br/>

Ascend to Heaven, by merit thine, and see<br/>

What life the Gods live there, and such live thou!"<br/>

So saying, he drew nigh, and to me held,<br/>

Even to my mouth of that same fruit held part<br/>

Which he had plucked; the pleasant savoury smell<br/>

So quickened appetite, that I, methought,<br/>

Could not but taste.  Forthwith up to the clouds<br/>

With him I flew, and underneath beheld<br/>

The earth outstretched immense, a prospect wide<br/>

And various:  Wondering at my flight and change<br/>

To this high exaltation; suddenly<br/>

My guide was gone, and I, methought, sunk down,<br/>

And fell asleep; but O, how glad I waked<br/>

To find this but a dream!  Thus Eve her night<br/>

Related, and thus Adam answered sad.<br/>

Best image of myself, and dearer half,<br/>

The trouble of thy thoughts this night in sleep<br/>

Affects me equally; nor can I like<br/>

This uncouth dream, of evil sprung, I fear;<br/>

Yet evil whence? in thee can harbour none,<br/>

Created pure.  But know that in the soul<br/>

Are many lesser faculties, that serve<br/>

Reason as chief; among these Fancy next<br/>

Her office holds; of all external things<br/>

Which the five watchful senses represent,<br/>

She forms imaginations, aery shapes,<br/>

Which Reason, joining or disjoining, frames<br/>

All what we affirm or what deny, and call<br/>

Our knowledge or opinion; then retires<br/>

Into her private cell, when nature rests.<br/>

Oft in her absence mimick Fancy wakes<br/>

To imitate her; but, misjoining shapes,<br/>

Wild work produces oft, and most in dreams;<br/>

Ill matching words and deeds long past or late.<br/>

Some such resemblances, methinks, I find<br/>

Of our last evening's talk, in this thy dream,<br/>

But with addition strange; yet be not sad.<br/>

Evil into the mind of God or Man<br/>

May come and go, so unreproved, and leave<br/>

No spot or blame behind:  Which gives me hope<br/>

That what in sleep thou didst abhor to dream,<br/>

Waking thou never will consent to do.<br/>

Be not disheartened then, nor cloud those looks,<br/>

That wont to be more cheerful and serene,<br/>

Than when fair morning first smiles on the world;<br/>

And let us to our fresh employments rise<br/>

Among the groves, the fountains, and the flowers<br/>

That open now their choisest bosomed smells,<br/>

Reserved from night, and kept for thee in store.<br/>

So cheered he his fair spouse, and she was cheered;<br/>

But silently a gentle tear let fall<br/>

From either eye, and wiped them with her hair;<br/>

Two other precious drops that ready stood,<br/>

Each in their crystal sluice, he ere they fell<br/>

Kissed, as the gracious signs of sweet remorse<br/>

And pious awe, that feared to have offended.<br/>

So all was cleared, and to the field they haste.<br/>

But first, from under shady arborous roof<br/>

Soon as they forth were come to open sight<br/>

Of day-spring, and the sun, who, scarce up-risen,<br/>

With wheels yet hovering o'er the ocean-brim,<br/>

Shot parallel to the earth his dewy ray,<br/>

Discovering in wide landskip all the east<br/>

Of Paradise and Eden's happy plains,<br/>

Lowly they bowed adoring, and began<br/>

Their orisons, each morning duly paid<br/>

In various style; for neither various style<br/>

Nor holy rapture wanted they to praise<br/>

Their Maker, in fit strains pronounced, or sung<br/>

Unmeditated; such prompt eloquence<br/>

Flowed from their lips, in prose or numerous verse,<br/>

More tuneable than needed lute or harp<br/>

To add more sweetness; and they thus began.<br/>

These are thy glorious works, Parent of good,<br/>

Almighty!  Thine this universal frame,<br/>

Thus wonderous fair;  Thyself how wonderous then!<br/>

Unspeakable, who sitst above these heavens<br/>

To us invisible, or dimly seen<br/>

In these thy lowest works; yet these declare<br/>

Thy goodness beyond thought, and power divine.<br/>

Speak, ye who best can tell, ye sons of light,<br/>

Angels; for ye behold him, and with songs<br/>

And choral symphonies, day without night,<br/>

Circle his throne rejoicing; ye in Heaven<br/>

On Earth join all ye Creatures to extol<br/>

Him first, him last, him midst, and without end.<br/>

Fairest of stars, last in the train of night,<br/>

If better thou belong not to the dawn,<br/>

Sure pledge of day, that crownest the smiling morn<br/>

With thy bright circlet, praise him in thy sphere,<br/>

While day arises, that sweet hour of prime.<br/>

Thou Sun, of this great world both eye and soul,<br/>

Acknowledge him thy greater; sound his praise<br/>

In thy eternal course, both when thou climbest,<br/>

And when high noon hast gained, and when thou fallest.<br/>

Moon, that now meetest the orient sun, now flyest,<br/>

With the fixed Stars, fixed in their orb that flies;<br/>

And ye five other wandering Fires, that move<br/>

In mystick dance not without song, resound<br/>

His praise, who out of darkness called up light.<br/>

Air, and ye Elements, the eldest birth<br/>

Of Nature's womb, that in quaternion run<br/>

Perpetual circle, multiform; and mix<br/>

And nourish all things; let your ceaseless change<br/>

Vary to our great Maker still new praise.<br/>

Ye Mists and Exhalations, that now rise<br/>

From hill or steaming lake, dusky or gray,<br/>

Till the sun paint your fleecy skirts with gold,<br/>

In honour to the world's great Author rise;<br/>

Whether to deck with clouds the uncoloured sky,<br/>

Or wet the thirsty earth with falling showers,<br/>

Rising or falling still advance his praise.<br/>

His praise, ye Winds, that from four quarters blow,<br/>

Breathe soft or loud; and, wave your tops, ye Pines,<br/>

With every plant, in sign of worship wave.<br/>

Fountains, and ye that warble, as ye flow,<br/>

Melodious murmurs, warbling tune his praise.<br/>

Join voices, all ye living Souls:  Ye Birds,<br/>

That singing up to Heaven-gate ascend,<br/>

Bear on your wings and in your notes his praise.<br/>

Ye that in waters glide, and ye that walk<br/>

The earth, and stately tread, or lowly creep;<br/>

Witness if I be silent, morn or even,<br/>

To hill, or valley, fountain, or fresh shade,<br/>

Made vocal by my song, and taught his praise.<br/>

Hail, universal Lord, be bounteous still<br/>

To give us only good; and if the night<br/>

Have gathered aught of evil, or concealed,<br/>

Disperse it, as now light dispels the dark!<br/>

So prayed they innocent, and to their thoughts<br/>

Firm peace recovered soon, and wonted calm.<br/>

On to their morning's rural work they haste,<br/>

Among sweet dews and flowers; where any row<br/>

Of fruit-trees over-woody reached too far<br/>

Their pampered boughs, and needed hands to check<br/>

Fruitless embraces: or they led the vine<br/>

To wed her elm; she, spoused, about him twines<br/>

Her marriageable arms, and with him brings<br/>

Her dower, the adopted clusters, to adorn<br/>

His barren leaves.  Them thus employed beheld<br/>

With pity Heaven's high King, and to him called<br/>

Raphael, the sociable Spirit, that deigned<br/>

To travel with Tobias, and secured<br/>

His marriage with the seventimes-wedded maid.<br/>

Raphael, said he, thou hearest what stir on Earth<br/>

Satan, from Hell 'scaped through the darksome gulf,<br/>

Hath raised in Paradise; and how disturbed<br/>

This night the human pair; how he designs<br/>

In them at once to ruin all mankind.<br/>

Go therefore, half this day as friend with friend<br/>

Converse with Adam, in what bower or shade<br/>

Thou findest him from the heat of noon retired,<br/>

To respite his day-labour with repast,<br/>

Or with repose; and such discourse bring on,<br/>

As may advise him of his happy state,<br/>

Happiness in his power left free to will,<br/>

Left to his own free will, his will though free,<br/>

Yet mutable; whence warn him to beware<br/>

He swerve not, too secure:  Tell him withal<br/>

His danger, and from whom; what enemy,<br/>

Late fallen himself from Heaven, is plotting now<br/>

The fall of others from like state of bliss;<br/>

By violence? no, for that shall be withstood;<br/>

But by deceit and lies:  This let him know,<br/>

Lest, wilfully transgressing, he pretend<br/>

Surprisal, unadmonished, unforewarned.<br/>

So spake the Eternal Father, and fulfilled<br/>

All justice:  Nor delayed the winged Saint<br/>

After his charge received; but from among<br/>

Thousand celestial Ardours, where he stood<br/>

Veiled with his gorgeous wings, up springing light,<br/>

Flew through the midst of Heaven; the angelick quires,<br/>

On each hand parting, to his speed gave way<br/>

Through all the empyreal road; till, at the gate<br/>

Of Heaven arrived, the gate self-opened wide<br/>

On golden hinges turning, as by work<br/>

Divine the sovran Architect had framed.<br/>

From hence no cloud, or, to obstruct his sight,<br/>

Star interposed, however small he sees,<br/>

Not unconformed to other shining globes,<br/>

Earth, and the garden of God, with cedars crowned<br/>

Above all hills.  As when by night the glass<br/>

Of Galileo, less assured, observes<br/>

Imagined lands and regions in the moon:<br/>

Or pilot, from amidst the Cyclades<br/>

Delos or Samos first appearing, kens<br/>

A cloudy spot.  Down thither prone in flight<br/>

He speeds, and through the vast ethereal sky<br/>

Sails between worlds and worlds, with steady wing<br/>

Now on the polar winds, then with quick fan<br/>

Winnows the buxom air; till, within soar<br/>

Of towering eagles, to all the fowls he seems<br/>

A phoenix, gazed by all as that sole bird,<br/>

When, to enshrine his reliques in the Sun's<br/>

Bright temple, to Egyptian Thebes he flies.<br/>

At once on the eastern cliff of Paradise<br/>

He lights, and to his proper shape returns<br/>

A Seraph winged:  Six wings he wore, to shade<br/>

His lineaments divine; the pair that clad<br/>

Each shoulder broad, came mantling o'er his breast<br/>

With regal ornament; the middle pair<br/>

Girt like a starry zone his waist, and round<br/>

Skirted his loins and thighs with downy gold<br/>

And colours dipt in Heaven; the third his feet<br/>

Shadowed from either heel with feathered mail,<br/>

Sky-tinctured grain.  Like Maia's son he stood,<br/>

And shook his plumes, that heavenly fragrance filled<br/>

The circuit wide.  Straight knew him all the bands<br/>

Of Angels under watch; and to his state,<br/>

And to his message high, in honour rise;<br/>

For on some message high they guessed him bound.<br/>

Their glittering tents he passed, and now is come<br/>

Into the blissful field, through groves of myrrh,<br/>

And flowering odours, cassia, nard, and balm;<br/>

A wilderness of sweets; for Nature here<br/>

Wantoned as in her prime, and played at will<br/>

Her virgin fancies pouring forth more sweet,<br/>

Wild above rule or art, enormous bliss.<br/>

Him through the spicy forest onward come<br/>

Adam discerned, as in the door he sat<br/>

Of his cool bower, while now the mounted sun<br/>

Shot down direct his fervid rays to warm<br/>

Earth's inmost womb, more warmth than Adam needs:<br/>

And Eve within, due at her hour prepared<br/>

For dinner savoury fruits, of taste to please<br/>

True appetite, and not disrelish thirst<br/>

Of nectarous draughts between, from milky stream,<br/>

Berry or grape:  To whom thus Adam called.<br/>

Haste hither, Eve, and worth thy sight behold<br/>

Eastward among those trees, what glorious shape<br/>

Comes this way moving; seems another morn<br/>

Risen on mid-noon; some great behest from Heaven<br/>

To us perhaps he brings, and will vouchsafe<br/>

This day to be our guest.  But go with speed,<br/>

And, what thy stores contain, bring forth, and pour<br/>

Abundance, fit to honour and receive<br/>

Our heavenly stranger:  Well we may afford<br/>

Our givers their own gifts, and large bestow<br/>

From large bestowed, where Nature multiplies<br/>

Her fertile growth, and by disburthening grows<br/>

More fruitful, which instructs us not to spare.<br/>

To whom thus Eve.  Adam, earth's hallowed mould,<br/>

Of God inspired! small store will serve, where store,<br/>

All seasons, ripe for use hangs on the stalk;<br/>

Save what by frugal storing firmness gains<br/>

To nourish, and superfluous moist consumes:<br/>

But I will haste, and from each bough and brake,<br/>

Each plant and juciest gourd, will pluck such choice<br/>

To entertain our Angel-guest, as he<br/>

Beholding shall confess, that here on Earth<br/>

God hath dispensed his bounties as in Heaven.<br/>

So saying, with dispatchful looks in haste<br/>

She turns, on hospitable thoughts intent<br/>

What choice to choose for delicacy best,<br/>

What order, so contrived as not to mix<br/>

Tastes, not well joined, inelegant, but bring<br/>

Taste after taste upheld with kindliest change;<br/>

Bestirs her then, and from each tender stalk<br/>

Whatever Earth, all-bearing mother, yields<br/>

In India East or West, or middle shore<br/>

In Pontus or the Punick coast, or where<br/>

Alcinous reigned, fruit of all kinds, in coat<br/>

Rough, or smooth rind, or bearded husk, or shell,<br/>

She gathers, tribute large, and on the board<br/>

Heaps with unsparing hand; for drink the grape<br/>

She crushes, inoffensive must, and meaths<br/>

From many a berry, and from sweet kernels pressed<br/>

She tempers dulcet creams; nor these to hold<br/>

Wants her fit vessels pure; then strows the ground<br/>

With rose and odours from the shrub unfumed.<br/>

Mean while our primitive great sire, to meet<br/>

His God-like guest, walks forth, without more train<br/>

Accompanied than with his own complete<br/>

Perfections; in himself was all his state,<br/>

More solemn than the tedious pomp that waits<br/>

On princes, when their rich retinue long<br/>

Of horses led, and grooms besmeared with gold,<br/>

Dazzles the croud, and sets them all agape.<br/>

Nearer his presence Adam, though not awed,<br/>

Yet with submiss approach and reverence meek,<br/>

As to a superiour nature bowing low,<br/>

Thus said.  Native of Heaven, for other place<br/>

None can than Heaven such glorious shape contain;<br/>

Since, by descending from the thrones above,<br/>

Those happy places thou hast deigned a while<br/>

To want, and honour these, vouchsafe with us<br/>

Two only, who yet by sovran gift possess<br/>

This spacious ground, in yonder shady bower<br/>

To rest; and what the garden choicest bears<br/>

To sit and taste, till this meridian heat<br/>

Be over, and the sun more cool decline.<br/>

Whom thus the angelick Virtue answered mild.<br/>

Adam, I therefore came; nor art thou such<br/>

Created, or such place hast here to dwell,<br/>

As may not oft invite, though Spirits of Heaven,<br/>

To visit thee; lead on then where thy bower<br/>

O'ershades; for these mid-hours, till evening rise,<br/>

I have at will.  So to the sylvan lodge<br/>

They came, that like Pomona's arbour smiled,<br/>

With flowerets decked, and fragrant smells; but Eve,<br/>

Undecked save with herself, more lovely fair<br/>

Than Wood-Nymph, or the fairest Goddess feigned<br/>

Of three that in mount Ida naked strove,<br/>

Stood to entertain her guest from Heaven; no veil<br/>

She needed, virtue-proof; no thought infirm<br/>

Altered her cheek.  On whom the Angel Hail<br/>

Bestowed, the holy salutation used<br/>

Long after to blest Mary, second Eve.<br/>

Hail, Mother of Mankind, whose fruitful womb<br/>

Shall fill the world more numerous with thy sons,<br/>

Than with these various fruits the trees of God<br/>

Have heaped this table!—Raised of grassy turf<br/>

Their table was, and mossy seats had round,<br/>

And on her ample square from side to side<br/>

All autumn piled, though spring and autumn here<br/>

Danced hand in hand.  A while discourse they hold;<br/>

No fear lest dinner cool; when thus began<br/>

Our author.  Heavenly stranger, please to taste<br/>

These bounties, which our Nourisher, from whom<br/>

All perfect good, unmeasured out, descends,<br/>

To us for food and for delight hath caused<br/>

The earth to yield; unsavoury food perhaps<br/>

To spiritual natures; only this I know,<br/>

That one celestial Father gives to all.<br/>

To whom the Angel.  Therefore what he gives<br/>

(Whose praise be ever sung) to Man in part<br/>

Spiritual, may of purest Spirits be found<br/>

No ingrateful food:  And food alike those pure<br/>

Intelligential substances require,<br/>

As doth your rational; and both contain<br/>

Within them every lower faculty<br/>

Of sense, whereby they hear, see, smell, touch, taste,<br/>

Tasting concoct, digest, assimilate,<br/>

And corporeal to incorporeal turn.<br/>

For know, whatever was created, needs<br/>

To be sustained and fed:  Of elements<br/>

The grosser feeds the purer, earth the sea,<br/>

Earth and the sea feed air, the air those fires<br/>

Ethereal, and as lowest first the moon;<br/>

Whence in her visage round those spots, unpurged<br/>

Vapours not yet into her substance turned.<br/>

Nor doth the moon no nourishment exhale<br/>

From her moist continent to higher orbs.<br/>

The sun that light imparts to all, receives<br/>

From all his alimental recompence<br/>

In humid exhalations, and at even<br/>

Sups with the ocean.  Though in Heaven the trees<br/>

Of life ambrosial fruitage bear, and vines<br/>

Yield nectar; though from off the boughs each morn<br/>

We brush mellifluous dews, and find the ground<br/>

Covered with pearly grain:  Yet God hath here<br/>

Varied his bounty so with new delights,<br/>

As may compare with Heaven; and to taste<br/>

Think not I shall be nice.  So down they sat,<br/>

And to their viands fell; nor seemingly<br/>

The Angel, nor in mist, the common gloss<br/>

Of Theologians; but with keen dispatch<br/>

Of real hunger, and concoctive heat<br/>

To transubstantiate:  What redounds, transpires<br/>

Through Spirits with ease; nor wonder; if by fire<br/>

Of sooty coal the empirick alchemist<br/>

Can turn, or holds it possible to turn,<br/>

Metals of drossiest ore to perfect gold,<br/>

As from the mine.  Mean while at table Eve<br/>

Ministered naked, and their flowing cups<br/>

With pleasant liquours crowned:  O innocence<br/>

Deserving Paradise! if ever, then,<br/>

Then had the sons of God excuse to have been<br/>

Enamoured at that sight; but in those hearts<br/>

Love unlibidinous reigned, nor jealousy<br/>

Was understood, the injured lover's hell.<br/>

Thus when with meats and drinks they had sufficed,<br/>

Not burdened nature, sudden mind arose<br/>

In Adam, not to let the occasion pass<br/>

Given him by this great conference to know<br/>

Of things above his world, and of their being<br/>

Who dwell in Heaven, whose excellence he saw<br/>

Transcend his own so far; whose radiant forms,<br/>

Divine effulgence, whose high power, so far<br/>

Exceeded human; and his wary speech<br/>

Thus to the empyreal minister he framed.<br/>

Inhabitant with God, now know I well<br/>

Thy favour, in this honour done to Man;<br/>

Under whose lowly roof thou hast vouchsafed<br/>

To enter, and these earthly fruits to taste,<br/>

Food not of Angels, yet accepted so,<br/>

As that more willingly thou couldst not seem<br/>

At Heaven's high feasts to have fed: yet what compare<br/>

To whom the winged Hierarch replied.<br/>

O Adam, One Almighty is, from whom<br/>

All things proceed, and up to him return,<br/>

If not depraved from good, created all<br/>

Such to perfection, one first matter all,<br/>

Endued with various forms, various degrees<br/>

Of substance, and, in things that live, of life;<br/>

But more refined, more spiritous, and pure,<br/>

As nearer to him placed, or nearer tending<br/>

Each in their several active spheres assigned,<br/>

Till body up to spirit work, in bounds<br/>

Proportioned to each kind.  So from the root<br/>

Springs lighter the green stalk, from thence the leaves<br/>

More aery, last the bright consummate flower<br/>

Spirits odorous breathes: flowers and their fruit,<br/>

Man's nourishment, by gradual scale sublimed,<br/>

To vital spirits aspire, to animal,<br/>

To intellectual; give both life and sense,<br/>

Fancy and understanding; whence the soul<br/>

Reason receives, and reason is her being,<br/>

Discursive, or intuitive; discourse<br/>

Is oftest yours, the latter most is ours,<br/>

Differing but in degree, of kind the same.<br/>

Wonder not then, what God for you saw good<br/>

If I refuse not, but convert, as you<br/>

To proper substance.  Time may come, when Men<br/>

With Angels may participate, and find<br/>

No inconvenient diet, nor too light fare;<br/>

And from these corporal nutriments perhaps<br/>

Your bodies may at last turn all to spirit,<br/>

Improved by tract of time, and, winged, ascend<br/>

Ethereal, as we; or may, at choice,<br/>

Here or in heavenly Paradises dwell;<br/>

If ye be found obedient, and retain<br/>

Unalterably firm his love entire,<br/>

Whose progeny you are.  Mean while enjoy<br/>

Your fill what happiness this happy state<br/>

Can comprehend, incapable of more.<br/>

To whom the patriarch of mankind replied.<br/>

O favourable Spirit, propitious guest,<br/>

Well hast thou taught the way that might direct<br/>

Our knowledge, and the scale of nature set<br/>

From center to circumference; whereon,<br/>

In contemplation of created things,<br/>

By steps we may ascend to God.  But say,<br/>

What meant that caution joined, If ye be found<br/>

Obedient?  Can we want obedience then<br/>

To him, or possibly his love desert,<br/>

Who formed us from the dust and placed us here<br/>

Full to the utmost measure of what bliss<br/>

Human desires can seek or apprehend?<br/>

To whom the Angel.  Son of Heaven and Earth,<br/>

Attend!  That thou art happy, owe to God;<br/>

That thou continuest such, owe to thyself,<br/>

That is, to thy obedience; therein stand.<br/>

This was that caution given thee; be advised.<br/>

God made thee perfect, not immutable;<br/>

And good he made thee, but to persevere<br/>

He left it in thy power; ordained thy will<br/>

By nature free, not over-ruled by fate<br/>

Inextricable, or strict necessity:<br/>

Our voluntary service he requires,<br/>

Not our necessitated; such with him<br/>

Finds no acceptance, nor can find; for how<br/>

Can hearts, not free, be tried whether they serve<br/>

Willing or no, who will but what they must<br/>

By destiny, and can no other choose?<br/>

Myself, and all the angelick host, that stand<br/>

In sight of God, enthroned, our happy state<br/>

Hold, as you yours, while our obedience holds;<br/>

On other surety none:  Freely we serve,<br/>

Because we freely love, as in our will<br/>

To love or not; in this we stand or fall:<br/>

And some are fallen, to disobedience fallen,<br/>

And so from Heaven to deepest Hell; O fall<br/>

From what high state of bliss, into what woe!<br/>

To whom our great progenitor.  Thy words<br/>

Attentive, and with more delighted ear,<br/>

Divine instructer, I have heard, than when<br/>

Cherubick songs by night from neighbouring hills<br/>

Aereal musick send:  Nor knew I not<br/>

To be both will and deed created free;<br/>

Yet that we never shall forget to love<br/>

Our Maker, and obey him whose command<br/>

Single is yet so just, my constant thoughts<br/>

Assured me, and still assure:  Though what thou tellest<br/>

Hath passed in Heaven, some doubt within me move,<br/>

But more desire to hear, if thou consent,<br/>

The full relation, which must needs be strange,<br/>

Worthy of sacred silence to be heard;<br/>

And we have yet large day, for scarce the sun<br/>

Hath finished half his journey, and scarce begins<br/>

His other half in the great zone of Heaven.<br/>

Thus Adam made request; and Raphael,<br/>

After short pause assenting, thus began.<br/>

High matter thou enjoinest me, O prime of men,<br/>

Sad task and hard:  For how shall I relate<br/>

To human sense the invisible exploits<br/>

Of warring Spirits? how, without remorse,<br/>

The ruin of so many glorious once<br/>

And perfect while they stood? how last unfold<br/>

The secrets of another world, perhaps<br/>

Not lawful to reveal? yet for thy good<br/>

This is dispensed; and what surmounts the reach<br/>

Of human sense, I shall delineate so,<br/>

By likening spiritual to corporal forms,<br/>

As may express them best; though what if Earth<br/>

Be but a shadow of Heaven, and things therein<br/>

Each to other like, more than on earth is thought?<br/>

As yet this world was not, and Chaos wild<br/>

Reigned where these Heavens now roll, where Earth now rests<br/>

Upon her center poised; when on a day<br/>

(For time, though in eternity, applied<br/>

To motion, measures all things durable<br/>

By present, past, and future,) on such day<br/>

As Heaven's great year brings forth, the empyreal host<br/>

Of Angels by imperial summons called,<br/>

Innumerable before the Almighty's throne<br/>

Forthwith, from all the ends of Heaven, appeared<br/>

Under their Hierarchs in orders bright:<br/>

Ten thousand thousand ensigns high advanced,<br/>

Standards and gonfalons 'twixt van and rear<br/>

Stream in the air, and for distinction serve<br/>

Of hierarchies, of orders, and degrees;<br/>

Or in their glittering tissues bear imblazed<br/>

Holy memorials, acts of zeal and love<br/>

Recorded eminent.  Thus when in orbs<br/>

Of circuit inexpressible they stood,<br/>

Orb within orb, the Father Infinite,<br/>

By whom in bliss imbosomed sat the Son,<br/>

Amidst as from a flaming mount, whose top<br/>

Brightness had made invisible, thus spake.<br/>

Hear, all ye Angels, progeny of light,<br/>

Thrones, Dominations, Princedoms, Virtues, Powers;<br/>

Hear my decree, which unrevoked shall stand.<br/>

This day I have begot whom I declare<br/>

My only Son, and on this holy hill<br/>

Him have anointed, whom ye now behold<br/>

At my right hand; your head I him appoint;<br/>

And by myself have sworn, to him shall bow<br/>

All knees in Heaven, and shall confess him Lord:<br/>

Under his great vice-gerent reign abide<br/>

United, as one individual soul,<br/>

For ever happy:  Him who disobeys,<br/>

Me disobeys, breaks union, and that day,<br/>

Cast out from God and blessed vision, falls<br/>

Into utter darkness, deep ingulfed, his place<br/>

Ordained without redemption, without end.<br/>

So spake the Omnipotent, and with his words<br/>

All seemed well pleased; all seemed, but were not all.<br/>

That day, as other solemn days, they spent<br/>

In song and dance about the sacred hill;<br/>

Mystical dance, which yonder starry sphere<br/>

Of planets, and of fixed, in all her wheels<br/>

Resembles nearest, mazes intricate,<br/>

Eccentrick, intervolved, yet regular<br/>

Then most, when most irregular they seem;<br/>

And in their motions harmony divine<br/>

So smooths her charming tones, that God's own ear<br/>

Listens delighted.  Evening now approached,<br/>

(For we have also our evening and our morn,<br/>

We ours for change delectable, not need;)<br/>

Forthwith from dance to sweet repast they turn<br/>

Desirous; all in circles as they stood,<br/>

Tables are set, and on a sudden piled<br/>

With Angels food, and rubied nectar flows<br/>

In pearl, in diamond, and massy gold,<br/>

Fruit of delicious vines, the growth of Heaven.<br/>

On flowers reposed, and with fresh flowerets crowned,<br/>

They eat, they drink, and in communion sweet<br/>

Quaff immortality and joy, secure<br/>

Of surfeit, where full measure only bounds<br/>

Excess, before the all-bounteous King, who showered<br/>

With copious hand, rejoicing in their joy.<br/>

Now when ambrosial night with clouds exhaled<br/>

From that high mount of God, whence light and shade<br/>

Spring both, the face of brightest Heaven had changed<br/>

To grateful twilight, (for night comes not there<br/>

In darker veil) and roseate dews disposed<br/>

All but the unsleeping eyes of God to rest;<br/>

Wide over all the plain, and wider far<br/>

Than all this globous earth in plain outspread,<br/>

(Such are the courts of God) the angelick throng,<br/>

Dispersed in bands and files, their camp extend<br/>

By living streams among the trees of life,<br/>

Pavilions numberless, and sudden reared,<br/>

Celestial tabernacles, where they slept<br/>

Fanned with cool winds; save those, who, in their course,<br/>

Melodious hymns about the sovran throne<br/>

Alternate all night long: but not so waked<br/>

Satan; so call him now, his former name<br/>

Is heard no more in Heaven; he of the first,<br/>

If not the first Arch-Angel, great in power,<br/>

In favour and pre-eminence, yet fraught<br/>

With envy against the Son of God, that day<br/>

Honoured by his great Father, and proclaimed<br/>

Messiah King anointed, could not bear<br/>

Through pride that sight, and thought himself impaired.<br/>

Deep malice thence conceiving and disdain,<br/>

Soon as midnight brought on the dusky hour<br/>

Friendliest to sleep and silence, he resolved<br/>

With all his legions to dislodge, and leave<br/>

Unworshipt, unobeyed, the throne supreme,<br/>

Contemptuous; and his next subordinate<br/>

Awakening, thus to him in secret spake.<br/>

Sleepest thou, Companion dear?  What sleep can close<br/>

Thy eye-lids? and rememberest what decree<br/>

Of yesterday, so late hath passed the lips<br/>

Of Heaven's Almighty.  Thou to me thy thoughts<br/>

Wast wont, I mine to thee was wont to impart;<br/>

Both waking we were one; how then can now<br/>

Thy sleep dissent?  New laws thou seest imposed;<br/>

New laws from him who reigns, new minds may raise<br/>

In us who serve, new counsels to debate<br/>

What doubtful may ensue:  More in this place<br/>

To utter is not safe.  Assemble thou<br/>

Of all those myriads which we lead the chief;<br/>

Tell them, that by command, ere yet dim night<br/>

Her shadowy cloud withdraws, I am to haste,<br/>

And all who under me their banners wave,<br/>

Homeward, with flying march, where we possess<br/>

The quarters of the north; there to prepare<br/>

Fit entertainment to receive our King,<br/>

The great Messiah, and his new commands,<br/>

Who speedily through all the hierarchies<br/>

Intends to pass triumphant, and give laws.<br/>

So spake the false Arch-Angel, and infused<br/>

Bad influence into the unwary breast<br/>

Of his associate:  He together calls,<br/>

Or several one by one, the regent Powers,<br/>

Under him Regent; tells, as he was taught,<br/>

That the Most High commanding, now ere night,<br/>

Now ere dim night had disincumbered Heaven,<br/>

The great hierarchal standard was to move;<br/>

Tells the suggested cause, and casts between<br/>

Ambiguous words and jealousies, to sound<br/>

Or taint integrity:  But all obeyed<br/>

The wonted signal, and superiour voice<br/>

Of their great Potentate; for great indeed<br/>

His name, and high was his degree in Heaven;<br/>

His countenance, as the morning-star that guides<br/>

The starry flock, allured them, and with lies<br/>

Drew after him the third part of Heaven's host.<br/>

Mean while the Eternal eye, whose sight discerns<br/>

Abstrusest thoughts, from forth his holy mount,<br/>

And from within the golden lamps that burn<br/>

Nightly before him, saw without their light<br/>

Rebellion rising; saw in whom, how spread<br/>

Among the sons of morn, what multitudes<br/>

Were banded to oppose his high decree;<br/>

And, smiling, to his only Son thus said.<br/>

Son, thou in whom my glory I behold<br/>

In full resplendence, Heir of all my might,<br/>

Nearly it now concerns us to be sure<br/>

Of our Omnipotence, and with what arms<br/>

We mean to hold what anciently we claim<br/>

Of deity or empire:  Such a foe<br/>

Is rising, who intends to erect his throne<br/>

Equal to ours, throughout the spacious north;<br/>

Nor so content, hath in his thought to try<br/>

In battle, what our power is, or our right.<br/>

Let us advise, and to this hazard draw<br/>

With speed what force is left, and all employ<br/>

In our defence; lest unawares we lose<br/>

This our high place, our sanctuary, our hill.<br/>

To whom the Son with calm aspect and clear,<br/>

Lightning divine, ineffable, serene,<br/>

Made answer.  Mighty Father, thou thy foes<br/>

Justly hast in derision, and, secure,<br/>

Laughest at their vain designs and tumults vain,<br/>

Matter to me of glory, whom their hate<br/>

Illustrates, when they see all regal power<br/>

Given me to quell their pride, and in event<br/>

Know whether I be dextrous to subdue<br/>

Thy rebels, or be found the worst in Heaven.<br/>

So spake the Son; but Satan, with his Powers,<br/>

Far was advanced on winged speed; an host<br/>

Innumerable as the stars of night,<br/>

Or stars of morning, dew-drops, which the sun<br/>

Impearls on every leaf and every flower.<br/>

Regions they passed, the mighty regencies<br/>

Of Seraphim, and Potentates, and Thrones,<br/>

In their triple degrees; regions to which<br/>

All thy dominion, Adam, is no more<br/>

Than what this garden is to all the earth,<br/>

And all the sea, from one entire globose<br/>

Stretched into longitude; which having passed,<br/>

At length into the limits of the north<br/>

They came; and Satan to his royal seat<br/>

High on a hill, far blazing, as a mount<br/>

Raised on a mount, with pyramids and towers<br/>

From diamond quarries hewn, and rocks of gold;<br/>

The palace of great Lucifer, (so call<br/>

That structure in the dialect of men<br/>

Interpreted,) which not long after, he<br/>

Affecting all equality with God,<br/>

In imitation of that mount whereon<br/>

Messiah was declared in sight of Heaven,<br/>

The Mountain of the Congregation called;<br/>

For thither he assembled all his train,<br/>

Pretending so commanded to consult<br/>

About the great reception of their King,<br/>

Thither to come, and with calumnious art<br/>

Of counterfeited truth thus held their ears.<br/>

Thrones, Dominations, Princedoms, Virtues, Powers;<br/>

If these magnifick titles yet remain<br/>

Not merely titular, since by decree<br/>

Another now hath to himself engrossed<br/>

All power, and us eclipsed under the name<br/>

Of King anointed, for whom all this haste<br/>

Of midnight-march, and hurried meeting here,<br/>

This only to consult how we may best,<br/>

With what may be devised of honours new,<br/>

Receive him coming to receive from us<br/>

Knee-tribute yet unpaid, prostration vile!<br/>

Too much to one! but double how endured,<br/>

To one, and to his image now proclaimed?<br/>

But what if better counsels might erect<br/>

Our minds, and teach us to cast off this yoke?<br/>

Will ye submit your necks, and choose to bend<br/>

The supple knee?  Ye will not, if I trust<br/>

To know ye right, or if ye know yourselves<br/>

Natives and sons of Heaven possessed before<br/>

By none; and if not equal all, yet free,<br/>

Equally free; for orders and degrees<br/>

Jar not with liberty, but well consist.<br/>

Who can in reason then, or right, assume<br/>

Monarchy over such as live by right<br/>

His equals, if in power and splendour less,<br/>

In freedom equal? or can introduce<br/>

Law and edict on us, who without law<br/>

Err not? much less for this to be our Lord,<br/>

And look for adoration, to the abuse<br/>

Of those imperial titles, which assert<br/>

Our being ordained to govern, not to serve.<br/>

Thus far his bold discourse without controul<br/>

Had audience; when among the Seraphim<br/>

Abdiel, than whom none with more zeal adored<br/>

The Deity, and divine commands obeyed,<br/>

Stood up, and in a flame of zeal severe<br/>

The current of his fury thus opposed.<br/>

O argument blasphemous, false, and proud!<br/>

Words which no ear ever to hear in Heaven<br/>

Expected, least of all from thee,  Ingrate,<br/>

In place thyself so high above thy peers.<br/>

Canst thou with impious obloquy condemn<br/>

The just decree of God, pronounced and sworn,<br/>

That to his only Son, by right endued<br/>

With regal scepter, every soul in Heaven<br/>

Shall bend the knee, and in that honour due<br/>

Confess him rightful King? unjust, thou sayest,<br/>

Flatly unjust, to bind with laws the free,<br/>

And equal over equals to let reign,<br/>

One over all with unsucceeded power.<br/>

Shalt thou give law to God? shalt thou dispute<br/>

With him the points of liberty, who made<br/>

Thee what thou art, and formed the Powers of Heaven<br/>

Such as he pleased, and circumscribed their being?<br/>

Yet, by experience taught, we know how good,<br/>

And of our good and of our dignity<br/>

How provident he is; how far from thought<br/>

To make us less, bent rather to exalt<br/>

Our happy state, under one head more near<br/>

United.  But to grant it thee unjust,<br/>

That equal over equals monarch reign:<br/>

Thyself, though great and glorious, dost thou count,<br/>

Or all angelick nature joined in one,<br/>

Equal to him begotten Son? by whom,<br/>

As by his Word, the Mighty Father made<br/>

All things, even thee; and all the Spirits of Heaven<br/>

By him created in their bright degrees,<br/>

Crowned them with glory, and to their glory named<br/>

Thrones, Dominations, Princedoms, Virtues, Powers,<br/>

Essential Powers; nor by his reign obscured,<br/>

But more illustrious made; since he the head<br/>

One of our number thus reduced becomes;<br/>

His laws our laws; all honour to him done<br/>

Returns our own.  Cease then this impious rage,<br/>

And tempt not these; but hasten to appease<br/>

The incensed Father, and the incensed Son,<br/>

While pardon may be found in time besought.<br/>

So spake the fervent Angel; but his zeal<br/>

None seconded, as out of season judged,<br/>

Or singular and rash:  Whereat rejoiced<br/>

The Apostate, and, more haughty, thus replied.<br/>

That we were formed then sayest thou? and the work<br/>

Of secondary hands, by task transferred<br/>

From Father to his Son? strange point and new!<br/>

Doctrine which we would know whence learned: who saw<br/>

When this creation was? rememberest thou<br/>

Thy making, while the Maker gave thee being?<br/>

We know no time when we were not as now;<br/>

Know none before us, self-begot, self-raised<br/>

By our own quickening power, when fatal course<br/>

Had circled his full orb, the birth mature<br/>

Of this our native Heaven, ethereal sons.<br/>

Our puissance is our own; our own right hand<br/>

Shall teach us highest deeds, by proof to try<br/>

Who is our equal:  Then thou shalt behold<br/>

Whether by supplication we intend<br/>

Address, and to begirt the almighty throne<br/>

Beseeching or besieging.  This report,<br/>

These tidings carry to the anointed King;<br/>

And fly, ere evil intercept thy flight.<br/>

He said; and, as the sound of waters deep,<br/>

Hoarse murmur echoed to his words applause<br/>

Through the infinite host; nor less for that<br/>

The flaming Seraph fearless, though alone<br/>

Encompassed round with foes, thus answered bold.<br/>

O alienate from God, O Spirit accursed,<br/>

Forsaken of all good!  I see thy fall<br/>

Determined, and thy hapless crew involved<br/>

In this perfidious fraud, contagion spread<br/>

Both of thy crime and punishment:  Henceforth<br/>

No more be troubled how to quit the yoke<br/>

Of God's Messiah; those indulgent laws<br/>

Will not be now vouchsafed; other decrees<br/>

Against thee are gone forth without recall;<br/>

That golden scepter, which thou didst reject,<br/>

Is now an iron rod to bruise and break<br/>

Thy disobedience.  Well thou didst advise;<br/>

Yet not for thy advice or threats I fly<br/>

These wicked tents devoted, lest the wrath<br/>

Impendent, raging into sudden flame,<br/>

Distinguish not:  For soon expect to feel<br/>

His thunder on thy head, devouring fire.<br/>

Then who created thee lamenting learn,<br/>

When who can uncreate thee thou shalt know.<br/>

So spake the Seraph Abdiel, faithful found<br/>

Among the faithless, faithful only he;<br/>

Among innumerable false, unmoved,<br/>

Unshaken, unseduced, unterrified,<br/>

His loyalty he kept, his love, his zeal;<br/>

Nor number, nor example, with him wrought<br/>

To swerve from truth, or change his constant mind,<br/>

Though single.  From amidst them forth he passed,<br/>

Long way through hostile scorn, which he sustained<br/>

Superiour, nor of violence feared aught;<br/>

And, with retorted scorn, his back he turned<br/>

On those proud towers to swift destruction doomed.<br/>

<h3 id="id00026" style="margin-top: 3em">Book VI</h3>
<p id="id00027" style="margin-top: 2em">All night the dreadless Angel, unpursued,<br/>

Through Heaven's wide champain held his way; till Morn,<br/>

Waked by the circling Hours, with rosy hand<br/>

Unbarred the gates of light.  There is a cave<br/>

Within the mount of God, fast by his throne,<br/>

Where light and darkness in perpetual round<br/>

Lodge and dislodge by turns, which makes through Heaven<br/>

Grateful vicissitude, like day and night;<br/>

Light issues forth, and at the other door<br/>

Obsequious darkness enters, till her hour<br/>

To veil the Heaven, though darkness there might well<br/>

Seem twilight here:  And now went forth the Morn<br/>

Such as in highest Heaven arrayed in gold<br/>

Empyreal; from before her vanished Night,<br/>

Shot through with orient beams; when all the plain<br/>

Covered with thick embattled squadrons bright,<br/>

Chariots, and flaming arms, and fiery steeds,<br/>

Reflecting blaze on blaze, first met his view:<br/>

War he perceived, war in procinct; and found<br/>

Already known what he for news had thought<br/>

To have reported:  Gladly then he mixed<br/>

Among those friendly Powers, who him received<br/>

With joy and acclamations loud, that one,<br/>

That of so many myriads fallen, yet one<br/>

Returned not lost.  On to the sacred hill<br/>

They led him high applauded, and present<br/>

Before the seat supreme; from whence a voice,<br/>

From midst a golden cloud, thus mild was heard.<br/>

Servant of God.  Well done; well hast thou fought<br/>

The better fight, who single hast maintained<br/>

Against revolted multitudes the cause<br/>

Of truth, in word mightier than they in arms;<br/>

And for the testimony of truth hast borne<br/>

Universal reproach, far worse to bear<br/>

Than violence; for this was all thy care<br/>

To stand approved in sight of God, though worlds<br/>

Judged thee perverse:  The easier conquest now<br/>

Remains thee, aided by this host of friends,<br/>

Back on thy foes more glorious to return,<br/>

Than scorned thou didst depart; and to subdue<br/>

By force, who reason for their law refuse,<br/>

Right reason for their law, and for their King<br/>

Messiah, who by right of merit reigns.<br/>

Go, Michael, of celestial armies prince,<br/>

And thou, in military prowess next,<br/>

Gabriel, lead forth to battle these my sons<br/>

Invincible; lead forth my armed Saints,<br/>

By thousands and by millions, ranged for fight,<br/>

Equal in number to that Godless crew<br/>

Rebellious:  Them with fire and hostile arms<br/>

Fearless assault; and, to the brow of Heaven<br/>

Pursuing, drive them out from God and bliss,<br/>

Into their place of punishment, the gulf<br/>

Of Tartarus, which ready opens wide<br/>

His fiery Chaos to receive their fall.<br/>

So spake the Sovran Voice, and clouds began<br/>

To darken all the hill, and smoke to roll<br/>

In dusky wreaths, reluctant flames, the sign<br/>

Of wrath awaked; nor with less dread the loud<br/>

Ethereal trumpet from on high 'gan blow:<br/>

At which command the Powers militant,<br/>

That stood for Heaven, in mighty quadrate joined<br/>

Of union irresistible, moved on<br/>

In silence their bright legions, to the sound<br/>

Of instrumental harmony, that breathed<br/>

Heroick ardour to adventurous deeds<br/>

Under their God-like leaders, in the cause<br/>

Of God and his Messiah.  On they move<br/>

Indissolubly firm; nor obvious hill,<br/>

Nor straitening vale, nor wood, nor stream, divides<br/>

Their perfect ranks; for high above the ground<br/>

Their march was, and the passive air upbore<br/>

Their nimble tread; as when the total kind<br/>

Of birds, in orderly array on wing,<br/>

Came summoned over Eden to receive<br/>

Their names of thee; so over many a tract<br/>

Of Heaven they marched, and many a province wide,<br/>

Tenfold the length of this terrene:  At last,<br/>

Far in the horizon to the north appeared<br/>

From skirt to skirt a fiery region, stretched<br/>

In battailous aspect, and nearer view<br/>

Bristled with upright beams innumerable<br/>

Of rigid spears, and helmets thronged, and shields<br/>

Various, with boastful argument portrayed,<br/>

The banded Powers of Satan hasting on<br/>

With furious expedition; for they weened<br/>

That self-same day, by fight or by surprise,<br/>

To win the mount of God, and on his throne<br/>

To set the Envier of his state, the proud<br/>

Aspirer; but their thoughts proved fond and vain<br/>

In the mid way:  Though strange to us it seemed<br/>

At first, that Angel should with Angel war,<br/>

And in fierce hosting meet, who wont to meet<br/>

So oft in festivals of joy and love<br/>

Unanimous, as sons of one great Sire,<br/>

Hymning the Eternal Father:  But the shout<br/>

Of battle now began, and rushing sound<br/>

Of onset ended soon each milder thought.<br/>

High in the midst, exalted as a God,<br/>

The Apostate in his sun-bright chariot sat,<br/>

Idol of majesty divine, enclosed<br/>

With flaming Cherubim, and golden shields;<br/>

Then lighted from his gorgeous throne, for now<br/>

'Twixt host and host but narrow space was left,<br/>

A dreadful interval, and front to front<br/>

Presented stood in terrible array<br/>

Of hideous length:  Before the cloudy van,<br/>

On the rough edge of battle ere it joined,<br/>

Satan, with vast and haughty strides advanced,<br/>

Came towering, armed in adamant and gold;<br/>

Abdiel that sight endured not, where he stood<br/>

Among the mightiest, bent on highest deeds,<br/>

And thus his own undaunted heart explores.<br/>

O Heaven! that such resemblance of the Highest<br/>

Should yet remain, where faith and realty<br/>

Remain not:  Wherefore should not strength and might<br/>

There fail where virtue fails, or weakest prove<br/>

Where boldest, though to fight unconquerable?<br/>

His puissance, trusting in the Almighty's aid,<br/>

I mean to try, whose reason I have tried<br/>

Unsound and false; nor is it aught but just,<br/>

That he, who in debate of truth hath won,<br/>

Should win in arms, in both disputes alike<br/>

Victor; though brutish that contest and foul,<br/>

When reason hath to deal with force, yet so<br/>

Most reason is that reason overcome.<br/>

So pondering, and from his armed peers<br/>

Forth stepping opposite, half-way he met<br/>

His daring foe, at this prevention more<br/>

Incensed, and thus securely him defied.<br/>

Proud, art thou met? thy hope was to have reached<br/>

The highth of thy aspiring unopposed,<br/>

The throne of God unguarded, and his side<br/>

Abandoned, at the terrour of thy power<br/>

Or potent tongue:  Fool! not to think how vain<br/>

Against the Omnipotent to rise in arms;<br/>

Who out of smallest things could, without end,<br/>

Have raised incessant armies to defeat<br/>

Thy folly; or with solitary hand<br/>

Reaching beyond all limit, at one blow,<br/>

Unaided, could have finished thee, and whelmed<br/>

Thy legions under darkness:  But thou seest<br/>

All are not of thy train; there be, who faith<br/>

Prefer, and piety to God, though then<br/>

To thee not visible, when I alone<br/>

Seemed in thy world erroneous to dissent<br/>

From all:  My sect thou seest; now learn too late<br/>

How few sometimes may know, when thousands err.<br/>

Whom the grand foe, with scornful eye askance,<br/>

Thus answered.  Ill for thee, but in wished hour<br/>

Of my revenge, first sought for, thou returnest<br/>

From flight, seditious Angel! to receive<br/>

Thy merited reward, the first assay<br/>

Of this right hand provoked, since first that tongue,<br/>

Inspired with contradiction, durst oppose<br/>

A third part of the Gods, in synod met<br/>

Their deities to assert; who, while they feel<br/>

Vigour divine within them, can allow<br/>

Omnipotence to none.  But well thou comest<br/>

Before thy fellows, ambitious to win<br/>

From me some plume, that thy success may show<br/>

Destruction to the rest:  This pause between,<br/>

(Unanswered lest thou boast) to let thee know,<br/>

At first I thought that Liberty and Heaven<br/>

To heavenly souls had been all one; but now<br/>

I see that most through sloth had rather serve,<br/>

Ministring Spirits, trained up in feast and song!<br/>

Such hast thou armed, the minstrelsy of Heaven,<br/>

Servility with freedom to contend,<br/>

As both their deeds compared this day shall prove.<br/>

To whom in brief thus Abdiel stern replied.<br/>

Apostate! still thou errest, nor end wilt find<br/>

Of erring, from the path of truth remote:<br/>

Unjustly thou depravest it with the name<br/>

Of servitude, to serve whom God ordains,<br/>

Or Nature:  God and Nature bid the same,<br/>

When he who rules is worthiest, and excels<br/>

Them whom he governs.  This is servitude,<br/>

To serve the unwise, or him who hath rebelled<br/>

Against his worthier, as thine now serve thee,<br/>

Thyself not free, but to thyself enthralled;<br/>

Yet lewdly darest our ministring upbraid.<br/>

Reign thou in Hell, thy kingdom; let me serve<br/>

In Heaven God ever blest, and his divine<br/>

Behests obey, worthiest to be obeyed;<br/>

Yet chains in Hell, not realms, expect:  Mean while<br/>

From me returned, as erst thou saidst, from flight,<br/>

This greeting on thy impious crest receive.<br/>

So saying, a noble stroke he lifted high,<br/>

Which hung not, but so swift with tempest fell<br/>

On the proud crest of Satan, that no sight,<br/>

Nor motion of swift thought, less could his shield,<br/>

Such ruin intercept:  Ten paces huge<br/>

He back recoiled; the tenth on bended knee<br/>

His massy spear upstaid; as if on earth<br/>

Winds under ground, or waters forcing way,<br/>

Sidelong had pushed a mountain from his seat,<br/>

Half sunk with all his pines.  Amazement seised<br/>

The rebel Thrones, but greater rage, to see<br/>

Thus foiled their mightiest; ours joy filled, and shout,<br/>

Presage of victory, and fierce desire<br/>

Of battle:  Whereat Michael bid sound<br/>

The Arch-Angel trumpet; through the vast of Heaven<br/>

It sounded, and the faithful armies rung<br/>

Hosanna to the Highest:  Nor stood at gaze<br/>

The adverse legions, nor less hideous joined<br/>

The horrid shock.  Now storming fury rose,<br/>

And clamour such as heard in Heaven till now<br/>

Was never; arms on armour clashing brayed<br/>

Horrible discord, and the madding wheels<br/>

Of brazen chariots raged; dire was the noise<br/>

Of conflict; over head the dismal hiss<br/>

Of fiery darts in flaming vollies flew,<br/>

And flying vaulted either host with fire.<br/>

So under fiery cope together rushed<br/>

Both battles main, with ruinous assault<br/>

And inextinguishable rage.  All Heaven<br/>

Resounded; and had Earth been then, all Earth<br/>

Had to her center shook.  What wonder? when<br/>

Millions of fierce encountering Angels fought<br/>

On either side, the least of whom could wield<br/>

These elements, and arm him with the force<br/>

Of all their regions:  How much more of power<br/>

Army against army numberless to raise<br/>

Dreadful combustion warring, and disturb,<br/>

Though not destroy, their happy native seat;<br/>

Had not the Eternal King Omnipotent,<br/>

From his strong hold of Heaven, high over-ruled<br/>

And limited their might; though numbered such<br/>

As each divided legion might have seemed<br/>

A numerous host; in strength each armed hand<br/>

A legion; led in fight, yet leader seemed<br/>

Each warriour single as in chief, expert<br/>

When to advance, or stand, or turn the sway<br/>

Of battle, open when, and when to close<br/>

The ridges of grim war:  No thought of flight,<br/>

None of retreat, no unbecoming deed<br/>

That argued fear; each on himself relied,<br/>

As only in his arm the moment lay<br/>

Of victory:  Deeds of eternal fame<br/>

Were done, but infinite; for wide was spread<br/>

That war and various; sometimes on firm ground<br/>

A standing fight, then, soaring on main wing,<br/>

Tormented all the air; all air seemed then<br/>

Conflicting fire.  Long time in even scale<br/>

The battle hung; till Satan, who that day<br/>

Prodigious power had shown, and met in arms<br/>

No equal, ranging through the dire attack<br/>

Of fighting Seraphim confused, at length<br/>

Saw where the sword of Michael smote, and felled<br/>

Squadrons at once; with huge two-handed sway<br/>

Brandished aloft, the horrid edge came down<br/>

Wide-wasting; such destruction to withstand<br/>

He hasted, and opposed the rocky orb<br/>

Of tenfold adamant, his ample shield,<br/>

A vast circumference.  At his approach<br/>

The great Arch-Angel from his warlike toil<br/>

Surceased, and glad, as hoping here to end<br/>

Intestine war in Heaven, the arch-foe subdued<br/>

Or captive dragged in chains, with hostile frown<br/>

And visage all inflamed first thus began.<br/>

Author of evil, unknown till thy revolt,<br/>

Unnamed in Heaven, now plenteous as thou seest<br/>

These acts of hateful strife, hateful to all,<br/>

Though heaviest by just measure on thyself,<br/>

And thy adherents:  How hast thou disturbed<br/>

Heaven's blessed peace, and into nature brought<br/>

Misery, uncreated till the crime<br/>

Of thy rebellion! how hast thou instilled<br/>

Thy malice into thousands, once upright<br/>

And faithful, now proved false!  But think not here<br/>

To trouble holy rest; Heaven casts thee out<br/>

From all her confines.  Heaven, the seat of bliss,<br/>

Brooks not the works of violence and war.<br/>

Hence then, and evil go with thee along,<br/>

Thy offspring, to the place of evil, Hell;<br/>

Thou and thy wicked crew! there mingle broils,<br/>

Ere this avenging sword begin thy doom,<br/>

Or some more sudden vengeance, winged from God,<br/>

Precipitate thee with augmented pain.<br/>

So spake the Prince of Angels; to whom thus<br/>

The Adversary.  Nor think thou with wind<br/>

Of aery threats to awe whom yet with deeds<br/>

Thou canst not.  Hast thou turned the least of these<br/>

To flight, or if to fall, but that they rise<br/>

Unvanquished, easier to transact with me<br/>

That thou shouldst hope, imperious, and with threats<br/>

To chase me hence? err not, that so shall end<br/>

The strife which thou callest evil, but we style<br/>

The strife of glory; which we mean to win,<br/>

Or turn this Heaven itself into the Hell<br/>

Thou fablest; here however to dwell free,<br/>

If not to reign:  Mean while thy utmost force,<br/>

And join him named Almighty to thy aid,<br/>

I fly not, but have sought thee far and nigh.<br/>

They ended parle, and both addressed for fight<br/>

Unspeakable; for who, though with the tongue<br/>

Of Angels, can relate, or to what things<br/>

Liken on earth conspicuous, that may lift<br/>

Human imagination to such highth<br/>

Of Godlike power? for likest Gods they seemed,<br/>

Stood they or moved, in stature, motion, arms,<br/>

Fit to decide the empire of great Heaven.<br/>

Now waved their fiery swords, and in the air<br/>

Made horrid circles; two broad suns their shields<br/>

Blazed opposite, while Expectation stood<br/>

In horrour:  From each hand with speed retired,<br/>

Where erst was thickest fight, the angelick throng,<br/>

And left large field, unsafe within the wind<br/>

Of such commotion; such as, to set forth<br/>

Great things by small, if, nature's concord broke,<br/>

Among the constellations war were sprung,<br/>

Two planets, rushing from aspect malign<br/>

Of fiercest opposition, in mid sky<br/>

Should combat, and their jarring spheres confound.<br/>

Together both with next to almighty arm<br/>

Up-lifted imminent, one stroke they aimed<br/>

That might determine, and not need repeat,<br/>

As not of power at once; nor odds appeared<br/>

In might or swift prevention:  But the sword<br/>

Of Michael from the armoury of God<br/>

Was given him tempered so, that neither keen<br/>

Nor solid might resist that edge: it met<br/>

The sword of Satan, with steep force to smite<br/>

Descending, and in half cut sheer; nor staid,<br/>

But with swift wheel reverse, deep entering, shared<br/>

All his right side:  Then Satan first knew pain,<br/>

And writhed him to and fro convolved; so sore<br/>

The griding sword with discontinuous wound<br/>

Passed through him:  But the ethereal substance closed,<br/>

Not long divisible; and from the gash<br/>

A stream of necturous humour issuing flowed<br/>

Sanguine, such as celestial Spirits may bleed,<br/>

And all his armour stained, ere while so bright.<br/>

Forthwith on all sides to his aid was run<br/>

By Angels many and strong, who interposed<br/>

Defence, while others bore him on their shields<br/>

Back to his chariot, where it stood retired<br/>

From off the files of war:  There they him laid<br/>

Gnashing for anguish, and despite, and shame,<br/>

To find himself not matchless, and his pride<br/>

Humbled by such rebuke, so far beneath<br/>

His confidence to equal God in power.<br/>

Yet soon he healed; for Spirits that live throughout<br/>

Vital in every part, not as frail man<br/>

In entrails, heart of head, liver or reins,<br/>

Cannot but by annihilating die;<br/>

Nor in their liquid texture mortal wound<br/>

Receive, no more than can the fluid air:<br/>

All heart they live, all head, all eye, all ear,<br/>

All intellect, all sense; and, as they please,<br/>

They limb themselves, and colour, shape, or size<br/>

Assume, as likes them best, condense or rare.<br/>

Mean while in other parts like deeds deserved<br/>

Memorial, where the might of Gabriel fought,<br/>

And with fierce ensigns pierced the deep array<br/>

Of Moloch, furious king; who him defied,<br/>

And at his chariot-wheels to drag him bound<br/>

Threatened, nor from the Holy One of Heaven<br/>

Refrained his tongue blasphemous; but anon<br/>

Down cloven to the waist, with shattered arms<br/>

And uncouth pain fled bellowing.  On each wing<br/>

Uriel, and Raphael, his vaunting foe,<br/>

Though huge, and in a rock of diamond armed,<br/>

Vanquished Adramelech, and Asmadai,<br/>

Two potent Thrones, that to be less than Gods<br/>

Disdained, but meaner thoughts learned in their flight,<br/>

Mangled with ghastly wounds through plate and mail.<br/>

Nor stood unmindful Abdiel to annoy<br/>

The atheist crew, but with redoubled blow<br/>

Ariel, and Arioch, and the violence<br/>

Of Ramiel scorched and blasted, overthrew.<br/>

I might relate of thousands, and their names<br/>

Eternize here on earth; but those elect<br/>

Angels, contented with their fame in Heaven,<br/>

Seek not the praise of men:  The other sort,<br/>

In might though wonderous and in acts of war,<br/>

Nor of renown less eager, yet by doom<br/>

Cancelled from Heaven and sacred memory,<br/>

Nameless in dark oblivion let them dwell.<br/>

For strength from truth divided, and from just,<br/>

Illaudable, nought merits but dispraise<br/>

And ignominy; yet to glory aspires<br/>

Vain-glorious, and through infamy seeks fame:<br/>

Therefore eternal silence be their doom.<br/>

And now, their mightiest quelled, the battle swerved,<br/>

With many an inroad gored; deformed rout<br/>

Entered, and foul disorder; all the ground<br/>

With shivered armour strown, and on a heap<br/>

Chariot and charioteer lay overturned,<br/>

And fiery-foaming steeds; what stood, recoiled<br/>

O'er-wearied, through the faint Satanick host<br/>

Defensive scarce, or with pale fear surprised,<br/>

Then first with fear surprised, and sense of pain,<br/>

Fled ignominious, to such evil brought<br/>

By sin of disobedience; till that hour<br/>

Not liable to fear, or flight, or pain.<br/>

Far otherwise the inviolable Saints,<br/>

In cubick phalanx firm, advanced entire,<br/>

Invulnerable, impenetrably armed;<br/>

Such high advantages their innocence<br/>

Gave them above their foes; not to have sinned,<br/>

Not to have disobeyed; in fight they stood<br/>

Unwearied, unobnoxious to be pained<br/>

By wound, though from their place by violence moved,<br/>

Now Night her course began, and, over Heaven<br/>

Inducing darkness, grateful truce imposed,<br/>

And silence on the odious din of war:<br/>

Under her cloudy covert both retired,<br/>

Victor and vanquished:  On the foughten field<br/>

Michael and his Angels prevalent<br/>

Encamping, placed in guard their watches round,<br/>

Cherubick waving fires:  On the other part,<br/>

Satan with his rebellious disappeared,<br/>

Far in the dark dislodged; and, void of rest,<br/>

His potentates to council called by night;<br/>

And in the midst thus undismayed began.<br/>

O now in danger tried, now known in arms<br/>

Not to be overpowered, Companions dear,<br/>

Found worthy not of liberty alone,<br/>

Too mean pretence! but what we more affect,<br/>

Honour, dominion, glory, and renown;<br/>

Who have sustained one day in doubtful fight,<br/>

(And if one day, why not eternal days?)<br/>

What Heaven's Lord had powerfullest to send<br/>

Against us from about his throne, and judged<br/>

Sufficient to subdue us to his will,<br/>

But proves not so:  Then fallible, it seems,<br/>

Of future we may deem him, though till now<br/>

Omniscient thought.  True is, less firmly armed,<br/>

Some disadvantage we endured and pain,<br/>

Till now not known, but, known, as soon contemned;<br/>

Since now we find this our empyreal form<br/>

Incapable of mortal injury,<br/>

Imperishable, and, though pierced with wound,<br/>

Soon closing, and by native vigour healed.<br/>

Of evil then so small as easy think<br/>

The remedy; perhaps more valid arms,<br/>

Weapons more violent, when next we meet,<br/>

May serve to better us, and worse our foes,<br/>

Or equal what between us made the odds,<br/>

In nature none:  If other hidden cause<br/>

Left them superiour, while we can preserve<br/>

Unhurt our minds, and understanding sound,<br/>

Due search and consultation will disclose.<br/>

He sat; and in the assembly next upstood<br/>

Nisroch, of Principalities the prime;<br/>

As one he stood escaped from cruel fight,<br/>

Sore toiled, his riven arms to havock hewn,<br/>

And cloudy in aspect thus answering spake.<br/>

Deliverer from new Lords, leader to free<br/>

Enjoyment of our right as Gods; yet hard<br/>

For Gods, and too unequal work we find,<br/>

Against unequal arms to fight in pain,<br/>

Against unpained, impassive; from which evil<br/>

Ruin must needs ensue; for what avails<br/>

Valour or strength, though matchless, quelled with pain<br/>

Which all subdues, and makes remiss the hands<br/>

Of mightiest?  Sense of pleasure we may well<br/>

Spare out of life perhaps, and not repine,<br/>

But live content, which is the calmest life:<br/>

But pain is perfect misery, the worst<br/>

Of evils, and, excessive, overturns<br/>

All patience.  He, who therefore can invent<br/>

With what more forcible we may offend<br/>

Our yet unwounded enemies, or arm<br/>

Ourselves with like defence, to me deserves<br/>

No less than for deliverance what we owe.<br/>

Whereto with look composed Satan replied.<br/>

Not uninvented that, which thou aright<br/>

Believest so main to our success, I bring.<br/>

Which of us who beholds the bright surface<br/>

Of this ethereous mould whereon we stand,<br/>

This continent of spacious Heaven, adorned<br/>

With plant, fruit, flower ambrosial, gems, and gold;<br/>

Whose eye so superficially surveys<br/>

These things, as not to mind from whence they grow<br/>

Deep under ground, materials dark and crude,<br/>

Of spiritous and fiery spume, till touched<br/>

With Heaven's ray, and tempered, they shoot forth<br/>

So beauteous, opening to the ambient light?<br/>

These in their dark nativity the deep<br/>

Shall yield us, pregnant with infernal flame;<br/>

Which, into hollow engines, long and round,<br/>

Thick rammed, at the other bore with touch of fire<br/>

Dilated and infuriate, shall send forth<br/>

From far, with thundering noise, among our foes<br/>

Such implements of mischief, as shall dash<br/>

To pieces, and o'erwhelm whatever stands<br/>

Adverse, that they shall fear we have disarmed<br/>

The Thunderer of his only dreaded bolt.<br/>

Nor long shall be our labour; yet ere dawn,<br/>

Effect shall end our wish.  Mean while revive;<br/>

Abandon fear; to strength and counsel joined<br/>

Think nothing hard, much less to be despaired.<br/>

He ended, and his words their drooping cheer<br/>

Enlightened, and their languished hope revived.<br/>

The invention all admired, and each, how he<br/>

To be the inventer missed; so easy it seemed<br/>

Once found, which yet unfound most would have thought<br/>

Impossible:  Yet, haply, of thy race<br/>

In future days, if malice should abound,<br/>

Some one intent on mischief, or inspired<br/>

With devilish machination, might devise<br/>

Like instrument to plague the sons of men<br/>

For sin, on war and mutual slaughter bent.<br/>

Forthwith from council to the work they flew;<br/>

None arguing stood; innumerable hands<br/>

Were ready; in a moment up they turned<br/>

Wide the celestial soil, and saw beneath<br/>

The originals of nature in their crude<br/>

Conception; sulphurous and nitrous foam<br/>

They found, they mingled, and, with subtle art,<br/>

Concocted and adusted they reduced<br/>

To blackest grain, and into store conveyed:<br/>

Part hidden veins digged up (nor hath this earth<br/>

Entrails unlike) of mineral and stone,<br/>

Whereof to found their engines and their balls<br/>

Of missive ruin; part incentive reed<br/>

Provide, pernicious with one touch to fire.<br/>

So all ere day-spring, under conscious night,<br/>

Secret they finished, and in order set,<br/>

With silent circumspection, unespied.<br/>

Now when fair morn orient in Heaven appeared,<br/>

Up rose the victor-Angels, and to arms<br/>

The matin trumpet sung:  In arms they stood<br/>

Of golden panoply, refulgent host,<br/>

Soon banded; others from the dawning hills<br/>

Look round, and scouts each coast light-armed scour,<br/>

Each quarter to descry the distant foe,<br/>

Where lodged, or whither fled, or if for fight,<br/>

In motion or in halt:  Him soon they met<br/>

Under spread ensigns moving nigh, in slow<br/>

But firm battalion; back with speediest sail<br/>

Zophiel, of Cherubim the swiftest wing,<br/>

Came flying, and in mid air aloud thus cried.<br/>

Arm, Warriours, arm for fight; the foe at hand,<br/>

Whom fled we thought, will save us long pursuit<br/>

This day; fear not his flight; so thick a cloud<br/>

He comes, and settled in his face I see<br/>

Sad resolution, and secure:  Let each<br/>

His adamantine coat gird well, and each<br/>

Fit well his helm, gripe fast his orbed shield,<br/>

Borne even or high; for this day will pour down,<br/>

If I conjecture aught, no drizzling shower,<br/>

But rattling storm of arrows barbed with fire.<br/>

So warned he them, aware themselves, and soon<br/>

In order, quit of all impediment;<br/>

Instant without disturb they took alarm,<br/>

And onward moved embattled:  When behold!<br/>

Not distant far with heavy pace the foe<br/>

Approaching gross and huge, in hollow cube<br/>

Training his devilish enginery, impaled<br/>

On every side with shadowing squadrons deep,<br/>

To hide the fraud.  At interview both stood<br/>

A while; but suddenly at head appeared<br/>

Satan, and thus was heard commanding loud.<br/>

Vanguard, to right and left the front unfold;<br/>

That all may see who hate us, how we seek<br/>

Peace and composure, and with open breast<br/>

Stand ready to receive them, if they like<br/>

Our overture; and turn not back perverse:<br/>

But that I doubt; however witness, Heaven!<br/>

Heaven, witness thou anon! while we discharge<br/>

Freely our part: ye, who appointed stand<br/>

Do as you have in charge, and briefly touch<br/>

What we propound, and loud that all may hear!<br/>

So scoffing in ambiguous words, he scarce<br/>

Had ended; when to right and left the front<br/>

Divided, and to either flank retired:<br/>

Which to our eyes discovered, new and strange,<br/>

A triple mounted row of pillars laid<br/>

On wheels (for like to pillars most they seemed,<br/>

Or hollowed bodies made of oak or fir,<br/>

With branches lopt, in wood or mountain felled,)<br/>

Brass, iron, stony mould, had not their mouths<br/>

With hideous orifice gaped on us wide,<br/>

Portending hollow truce:  At each behind<br/>

A Seraph stood, and in his hand a reed<br/>

Stood waving tipt with fire; while we, suspense,<br/>

Collected stood within our thoughts amused,<br/>

Not long; for sudden all at once their reeds<br/>

Put forth, and to a narrow vent applied<br/>

With nicest touch.  Immediate in a flame,<br/>

But soon obscured with smoke, all Heaven appeared,<br/>

From those deep-throated engines belched, whose roar<br/>

Embowelled with outrageous noise the air,<br/>

And all her entrails tore, disgorging foul<br/>

Their devilish glut, chained thunderbolts and hail<br/>

Of iron globes; which, on the victor host<br/>

Levelled, with such impetuous fury smote,<br/>

That, whom they hit, none on their feet might stand,<br/>

Though standing else as rocks, but down they fell<br/>

By thousands, Angel on Arch-Angel rolled;<br/>

The sooner for their arms; unarmed, they might<br/>

Have easily, as Spirits, evaded swift<br/>

By quick contraction or remove; but now<br/>

Foul dissipation followed, and forced rout;<br/>

Nor served it to relax their serried files.<br/>

What should they do? if on they rushed, repulse<br/>

Repeated, and indecent overthrow<br/>

Doubled, would render them yet more despised,<br/>

And to their foes a laughter; for in view<br/>

Stood ranked of Seraphim another row,<br/>

In posture to displode their second tire<br/>

Of thunder:  Back defeated to return<br/>

They worse abhorred.  Satan beheld their plight,<br/>

And to his mates thus in derision called.<br/>

O Friends! why come not on these victors proud<br/>

Ere while they fierce were coming; and when we,<br/>

To entertain them fair with open front<br/>

And breast, (what could we more?) propounded terms<br/>

Of composition, straight they changed their minds,<br/>

Flew off, and into strange vagaries fell,<br/>

As they would dance; yet for a dance they seemed<br/>

Somewhat extravagant and wild; perhaps<br/>

For joy of offered peace:  But I suppose,<br/>

If our proposals once again were heard,<br/>

We should compel them to a quick result.<br/>

To whom thus Belial, in like gamesome mood.<br/>

Leader! the terms we sent were terms of weight,<br/>

Of hard contents, and full of force urged home;<br/>

Such as we might perceive amused them all,<br/>

And stumbled many:  Who receives them right,<br/>

Had need from head to foot well understand;<br/>

Not understood, this gift they have besides,<br/>

They show us when our foes walk not upright.<br/>

So they among themselves in pleasant vein<br/>

Stood scoffing, hightened in their thoughts beyond<br/>

All doubt of victory:  Eternal Might<br/>

To match with their inventions they presumed<br/>

So easy, and of his thunder made a scorn,<br/>

And all his host derided, while they stood<br/>

A while in trouble:  But they stood not long;<br/>

Rage prompted them at length, and found them arms<br/>

Against such hellish mischief fit to oppose.<br/>

Forthwith (behold the excellence, the power,<br/>

Which God hath in his mighty Angels placed!)<br/>

Their arms away they threw, and to the hills<br/>

(For Earth hath this variety from Heaven<br/>

Of pleasure situate in hill and dale,)<br/>

Light as the lightning glimpse they ran, they flew;<br/>

From their foundations loosening to and fro,<br/>

They plucked the seated hills, with all their load,<br/>

Rocks, waters, woods, and by the shaggy tops<br/>

Up-lifting bore them in their hands:  Amaze,<br/>

Be sure, and terrour, seized the rebel host,<br/>

When coming towards them so dread they saw<br/>

The bottom of the mountains upward turned;<br/>

Till on those cursed engines' triple-row<br/>

They saw them whelmed, and all their confidence<br/>

Under the weight of mountains buried deep;<br/>

Themselves invaded next, and on their heads<br/>

Main promontories flung, which in the air<br/>

Came shadowing, and oppressed whole legions armed;<br/>

Their armour helped their harm, crushed in and bruised<br/>

Into their substance pent, which wrought them pain<br/>

Implacable, and many a dolorous groan;<br/>

Long struggling underneath, ere they could wind<br/>

Out of such prison, though Spirits of purest light,<br/>

Purest at first, now gross by sinning grown.<br/>

The rest, in imitation, to like arms<br/>

Betook them, and the neighbouring hills uptore:<br/>

So hills amid the air encountered hills,<br/>

Hurled to and fro with jaculation dire;<br/>

That under ground they fought in dismal shade;<br/>

Infernal noise! war seemed a civil game<br/>

To this uproar; horrid confusion heaped<br/>

Upon confusion rose:  And now all Heaven<br/>

Had gone to wrack, with ruin overspread;<br/>

Had not the Almighty Father, where he sits<br/>

Shrined in his sanctuary of Heaven secure,<br/>

Consulting on the sum of things, foreseen<br/>

This tumult, and permitted all, advised:<br/>

That his great purpose he might so fulfil,<br/>

To honour his anointed Son avenged<br/>

Upon his enemies, and to declare<br/>

All power on him transferred:  Whence to his Son,<br/>

The Assessour of his throne, he thus began.<br/>

Effulgence of my glory, Son beloved,<br/>

Son, in whose face invisible is beheld<br/>

Visibly, what by Deity I am;<br/>

And in whose hand what by decree I do,<br/>

Second Omnipotence! two days are past,<br/>

Two days, as we compute the days of Heaven,<br/>

Since Michael and his Powers went forth to tame<br/>

These disobedient:  Sore hath been their fight,<br/>

As likeliest was, when two such foes met armed;<br/>

For to themselves I left them; and thou knowest,<br/>

Equal in their creation they were formed,<br/>

Save what sin hath impaired; which yet hath wrought<br/>

Insensibly, for I suspend their doom;<br/>

Whence in perpetual fight they needs must last<br/>

Endless, and no solution will be found:<br/>

War wearied hath performed what war can do,<br/>

And to disordered rage let loose the reins<br/>

With mountains, as with weapons, armed; which makes<br/>

Wild work in Heaven, and dangerous to the main.<br/>

Two days are therefore past, the third is thine;<br/>

For thee I have ordained it; and thus far<br/>

Have suffered, that the glory may be thine<br/>

Of ending this great war, since none but Thou<br/>

Can end it.  Into thee such virtue and grace<br/>

Immense I have transfused, that all may know<br/>

In Heaven and Hell thy power above compare;<br/>

And, this perverse commotion governed thus,<br/>

To manifest thee worthiest to be Heir<br/>

Of all things; to be Heir, and to be King<br/>

By sacred unction, thy deserved right.<br/>

Go then, Thou Mightiest, in thy Father's might;<br/>

Ascend my chariot, guide the rapid wheels<br/>

That shake Heaven's basis, bring forth all my war,<br/>

My bow and thunder, my almighty arms<br/>

Gird on, and sword upon thy puissant thigh;<br/>

Pursue these sons of darkness, drive them out<br/>

From all Heaven's bounds into the utter deep:<br/>

There let them learn, as likes them, to despise<br/>

God, and Messiah his anointed King.<br/>

He said, and on his Son with rays direct<br/>

Shone full; he all his Father full expressed<br/>

Ineffably into his face received;<br/>

And thus the Filial Godhead answering spake.<br/>

O Father, O Supreme of heavenly Thrones,<br/>

First, Highest, Holiest, Best; thou always seek'st<br/>

To glorify thy Son, I always thee,<br/>

As is most just:  This I my glory account,<br/>

My exaltation, and my whole delight,<br/>

That thou, in me well pleased, declarest thy will<br/>

Fulfilled, which to fulfil is all my bliss.<br/>

Scepter and power, thy giving, I assume,<br/>

And gladlier shall resign, when in the end<br/>

Thou shalt be all in all, and I in thee<br/>

For ever; and in me all whom thou lovest:<br/>

But whom thou hatest, I hate, and can put on<br/>

Thy terrours, as I put thy mildness on,<br/>

Image of thee in all things; and shall soon,<br/>

Armed with thy might, rid Heaven of these rebelled;<br/>

To their prepared ill mansion driven down,<br/>

To chains of darkness, and the undying worm;<br/>

That from thy just obedience could revolt,<br/>

Whom to obey is happiness entire.<br/>

Then shall thy Saints unmixed, and from the impure<br/>

Far separate, circling thy holy mount,<br/>

Unfeigned Halleluiahs to thee sing,<br/>

Hymns of high praise, and I among them Chief.<br/>

So said, he, o'er his scepter bowing, rose<br/>

From the right hand of Glory where he sat;<br/>

And the third sacred morn began to shine,<br/>

Dawning through Heaven.  Forth rushed with whirlwind sound<br/>

The chariot of Paternal Deity,<br/>

Flashing thick flames, wheel within wheel undrawn,<br/>

Itself instinct with Spirit, but convoyed<br/>

By four Cherubick shapes; four faces each<br/>

Had wonderous; as with stars, their bodies all<br/>

And wings were set with eyes; with eyes the wheels<br/>

Of beryl, and careering fires between;<br/>

Over their heads a crystal firmament,<br/>

Whereon a sapphire throne, inlaid with pure<br/>

Amber, and colours of the showery arch.<br/>

He, in celestial panoply all armed<br/>

Of radiant Urim, work divinely wrought,<br/>

Ascended; at his right hand Victory<br/>

Sat eagle-winged; beside him hung his bow<br/>

And quiver with three-bolted thunder stored;<br/>

And from about him fierce effusion rolled<br/>

Of smoke, and bickering flame, and sparkles dire:<br/>

Attended with ten thousand thousand Saints,<br/>

He onward came; far off his coming shone;<br/>

And twenty thousand (I their number heard)<br/>

Chariots of God, half on each hand, were seen;<br/>

He on the wings of Cherub rode sublime<br/>

On the crystalline sky, in sapphire throned,<br/>

Illustrious far and wide; but by his own<br/>

First seen:  Them unexpected joy surprised,<br/>

When the great ensign of Messiah blazed<br/>

Aloft by Angels borne, his sign in Heaven;<br/>

Under whose conduct Michael soon reduced<br/>

His army, circumfused on either wing,<br/>

Under their Head imbodied all in one.<br/>

Before him Power Divine his way prepared;<br/>

At his command the uprooted hills retired<br/>

Each to his place; they heard his voice, and went<br/>

Obsequious; Heaven his wonted face renewed,<br/>

And with fresh flowerets hill and valley smiled.<br/>

This saw his hapless foes, but stood obdured,<br/>

And to rebellious fight rallied their Powers,<br/>

Insensate, hope conceiving from despair.<br/>

In heavenly Spirits could such perverseness dwell?<br/>

But to convince the proud what signs avail,<br/>

Or wonders move the obdurate to relent?<br/>

They, hardened more by what might most reclaim,<br/>

Grieving to see his glory, at the sight<br/>

Took envy; and, aspiring to his highth,<br/>

Stood re-embattled fierce, by force or fraud<br/>

Weening to prosper, and at length prevail<br/>

Against God and Messiah, or to fall<br/>

In universal ruin last; and now<br/>

To final battle drew, disdaining flight,<br/>

Or faint retreat; when the great Son of God<br/>

To all his host on either hand thus spake.<br/>

Stand still in bright array, ye Saints; here stand,<br/>

Ye Angels armed; this day from battle rest:<br/>

Faithful hath been your warfare, and of God<br/>

Accepted, fearless in his righteous cause;<br/>

And as ye have received, so have ye done,<br/>

Invincibly:  But of this cursed crew<br/>

The punishment to other hand belongs;<br/>

Vengeance is his, or whose he sole appoints:<br/>

Number to this day's work is not ordained,<br/>

Nor multitude; stand only, and behold<br/>

God's indignation on these godless poured<br/>

By me; not you, but me, they have despised,<br/>

Yet envied; against me is all their rage,<br/>

Because the Father, to whom in Heaven s'preme<br/>

Kingdom, and power, and glory appertains,<br/>

Hath honoured me, according to his will.<br/>

Therefore to me their doom he hath assigned;<br/>

That they may have their wish, to try with me<br/>

In battle which the stronger proves; they all,<br/>

Or I alone against them; since by strength<br/>

They measure all, of other excellence<br/>

Not emulous, nor care who them excels;<br/>

Nor other strife with them do I vouchsafe.<br/>

So spake the Son, and into terrour changed<br/>

His countenance too severe to be beheld,<br/>

And full of wrath bent on his enemies.<br/>

At once the Four spread out their starry wings<br/>

With dreadful shade contiguous, and the orbs<br/>

Of his fierce chariot rolled, as with the sound<br/>

Of torrent floods, or of a numerous host.<br/>

He on his impious foes right onward drove,<br/>

Gloomy as night; under his burning wheels<br/>

The stedfast empyrean shook throughout,<br/>

All but the throne itself of God.  Full soon<br/>

Among them he arrived; in his right hand<br/>

Grasping ten thousand thunders, which he sent<br/>

Before him, such as in their souls infixed<br/>

Plagues:  They, astonished, all resistance lost,<br/>

All courage; down their idle weapons dropt:<br/>

O'er shields, and helms, and helmed heads he rode<br/>

Of Thrones and mighty Seraphim prostrate,<br/>

That wished the mountains now might be again<br/>

Thrown on them, as a shelter from his ire.<br/>

Nor less on either side tempestuous fell<br/>

His arrows, from the fourfold-visaged Four<br/>

Distinct with eyes, and from the living wheels<br/>

Distinct alike with multitude of eyes;<br/>

One Spirit in them ruled; and every eye<br/>

Glared lightning, and shot forth pernicious fire<br/>

Among the accursed, that withered all their strength,<br/>

And of their wonted vigour left them drained,<br/>

Exhausted, spiritless, afflicted, fallen.<br/>

Yet half his strength he put not forth, but checked<br/>

His thunder in mid volley; for he meant<br/>

Not to destroy, but root them out of Heaven:<br/>

The overthrown he raised, and as a herd<br/>

Of goats or timorous flock together thronged<br/>

Drove them before him thunder-struck, pursued<br/>

With terrours, and with furies, to the bounds<br/>

And crystal wall of Heaven; which, opening wide,<br/>

Rolled inward, and a spacious gap disclosed<br/>

Into the wasteful deep:  The monstrous sight<br/>

Struck them with horrour backward, but far worse<br/>

Urged them behind:  Headlong themselves they threw<br/>

Down from the verge of Heaven; eternal wrath<br/>

Burnt after them to the bottomless pit.<br/>

Hell heard the unsufferable noise, Hell saw<br/>

Heaven ruining from Heaven, and would have fled<br/>

Affrighted; but strict Fate had cast too deep<br/>

Her dark foundations, and too fast had bound.<br/>

Nine days they fell:  Confounded Chaos roared,<br/>

And felt tenfold confusion in their fall<br/>

Through his wild anarchy, so huge a rout<br/>

Incumbered him with ruin:  Hell at last<br/>

Yawning received them whole, and on them closed;<br/>

Hell, their fit habitation, fraught with fire<br/>

Unquenchable, the house of woe and pain.<br/>

Disburdened Heaven rejoiced, and soon repaired<br/>

Her mural breach, returning whence it rolled.<br/>

Sole victor, from the expulsion of his foes,<br/>

Messiah his triumphal chariot turned:<br/>

To meet him all his Saints, who silent stood<br/>

Eye-witnesses of his almighty acts,<br/>

With jubilee advanced; and, as they went,<br/>

Shaded with branching palm, each Order bright,<br/>

Sung triumph, and him sung victorious King,<br/>

Son, Heir, and Lord, to him dominion given,<br/>

Worthiest to reign:  He, celebrated, rode<br/>

Triumphant through mid Heaven, into the courts<br/>

And temple of his Mighty Father throned<br/>

On high; who into glory him received,<br/>

Where now he sits at the right hand of bliss.<br/>

Thus, measuring things in Heaven by things on Earth,<br/>

At thy request, and that thou mayest beware<br/>

By what is past, to thee I have revealed<br/>

What might have else to human race been hid;<br/>

The discord which befel, and war in Heaven<br/>

Among the angelick Powers, and the deep fall<br/>

Of those too high aspiring, who rebelled<br/>

With Satan; he who envies now thy state,<br/>

Who now is plotting how he may seduce<br/>

Thee also from obedience, that, with him<br/>

Bereaved of happiness, thou mayest partake<br/>

His punishment, eternal misery;<br/>

Which would be all his solace and revenge,<br/>

As a despite done against the Most High,<br/>

Thee once to gain companion of his woe.<br/>

But listen not to his temptations, warn<br/>

Thy weaker; let it profit thee to have heard,<br/>

By terrible example, the reward<br/>

Of disobedience; firm they might have stood,<br/>

Yet fell; remember, and fear to transgress.<br/>

<h3 id="id00028" style="margin-top: 3em">Book VII</h3>
<p id="id00029" style="margin-top: 2em">Descend from Heaven, Urania, by that name<br/>

If rightly thou art called, whose voice divine<br/>

Following, above the Olympian hill I soar,<br/>

Above the flight of Pegasean wing!<br/>

The meaning, not the name, I call: for thou<br/>

Nor of the Muses nine, nor on the top<br/>

Of old Olympus dwellest; but, heavenly-born,<br/>

Before the hills appeared, or fountain flowed,<br/>

Thou with eternal Wisdom didst converse,<br/>

Wisdom thy sister, and with her didst play<br/>

In presence of the Almighty Father, pleased<br/>

With thy celestial song.  Up led by thee<br/>

Into the Heaven of Heavens I have presumed,<br/>

An earthly guest, and drawn empyreal air,<br/>

Thy tempering: with like safety guided down<br/>

Return me to my native element:<br/>

Lest from this flying steed unreined, (as once<br/>

Bellerophon, though from a lower clime,)<br/>

Dismounted, on the Aleian field I fall,<br/>

Erroneous there to wander, and forlorn.<br/>

Half yet remains unsung, but narrower bound<br/>

Within the visible diurnal sphere;<br/>

Standing on earth, not rapt above the pole,<br/>

More safe I sing with mortal voice, unchanged<br/>

To hoarse or mute, though fallen on evil days,<br/>

On evil days though fallen, and evil tongues;<br/>

In darkness, and with dangers compassed round,<br/>

And solitude; yet not alone, while thou<br/>

Visitest my slumbers nightly, or when morn<br/>

Purples the east: still govern thou my song,<br/>

Urania, and fit audience find, though few.<br/>

But drive far off the barbarous dissonance<br/>

Of Bacchus and his revellers, the race<br/>

Of that wild rout that tore the Thracian bard<br/>

In Rhodope, where woods and rocks had ears<br/>

To rapture, till the savage clamour drowned<br/>

Both harp and voice; nor could the Muse defend<br/>

Her son.  So fail not thou, who thee implores:<br/>

For thou art heavenly, she an empty dream.<br/>

Say, Goddess, what ensued when Raphael,<br/>

The affable Arch-Angel, had forewarned<br/>

Adam, by dire example, to beware<br/>

Apostasy, by what befel in Heaven<br/>

To those apostates; lest the like befall<br/>

In Paradise to Adam or his race,<br/>

Charged not to touch the interdicted tree,<br/>

If they transgress, and slight that sole command,<br/>

So easily obeyed amid the choice<br/>

Of all tastes else to please their appetite,<br/>

Though wandering.  He, with his consorted Eve,<br/>

The story heard attentive, and was filled<br/>

With admiration and deep muse, to hear<br/>

Of things so high and strange; things, to their thought<br/>

So unimaginable, as hate in Heaven,<br/>

And war so near the peace of God in bliss,<br/>

With such confusion: but the evil, soon<br/>

Driven back, redounded as a flood on those<br/>

From whom it sprung; impossible to mix<br/>

With blessedness.  Whence Adam soon repealed<br/>

The doubts that in his heart arose: and now<br/>

Led on, yet sinless, with desire to know<br/>

What nearer might concern him, how this world<br/>

Of Heaven and Earth conspicuous first began;<br/>

When, and whereof created; for what cause;<br/>

What within Eden, or without, was done<br/>

Before his memory; as one whose drouth<br/>

Yet scarce allayed still eyes the current stream,<br/>

Whose liquid murmur heard new thirst excites,<br/>

Proceeded thus to ask his heavenly guest.<br/>

Great things, and full of wonder in our ears,<br/>

Far differing from this world, thou hast revealed,<br/>

Divine interpreter! by favour sent<br/>

Down from the empyrean, to forewarn<br/>

Us timely of what might else have been our loss,<br/>

Unknown, which human knowledge could not reach;<br/>

For which to the infinitely Good we owe<br/>

Immortal thanks, and his admonishment<br/>

Receive, with solemn purpose to observe<br/>

Immutably his sovran will, the end<br/>

Of what we are.  But since thou hast vouchsafed<br/>

Gently, for our instruction, to impart<br/>

Things above earthly thought, which yet concerned<br/>

Our knowing, as to highest wisdom seemed,<br/>

Deign to descend now lower, and relate<br/>

What may no less perhaps avail us known,<br/>

How first began this Heaven which we behold<br/>

Distant so high, with moving fires adorned<br/>

Innumerable; and this which yields or fills<br/>

All space, the ambient air wide interfused<br/>

Embracing round this floried Earth; what cause<br/>

Moved the Creator, in his holy rest<br/>

Through all eternity, so late to build<br/>

In Chaos; and the work begun, how soon<br/>

Absolved; if unforbid thou mayest unfold<br/>

What we, not to explore the secrets ask<br/>

Of his eternal empire, but the more<br/>

To magnify his works, the more we know.<br/>

And the great light of day yet wants to run<br/>

Much of his race though steep; suspense in Heaven,<br/>

Held by thy voice, thy potent voice, he hears,<br/>

And longer will delay to hear thee tell<br/>

His generation, and the rising birth<br/>

Of Nature from the unapparent Deep:<br/>

Or if the star of evening and the moon<br/>

Haste to thy audience, Night with her will bring,<br/>

Silence; and Sleep, listening to thee, will watch;<br/>

Or we can bid his absence, till thy song<br/>

End, and dismiss thee ere the morning shine.<br/>

Thus Adam his illustrious guest besought:<br/>

And thus the Godlike Angel answered mild.<br/>

This also thy request, with caution asked,<br/>

Obtain; though to recount almighty works<br/>

What words or tongue of Seraph can suffice,<br/>

Or heart of man suffice to comprehend?<br/>

Yet what thou canst attain, which best may serve<br/>

To glorify the Maker, and infer<br/>

Thee also happier, shall not be withheld<br/>

Thy hearing; such commission from above<br/>

I have received, to answer thy desire<br/>

Of knowledge within bounds; beyond, abstain<br/>

To ask; nor let thine own inventions hope<br/>

Things not revealed, which the invisible King,<br/>

Only Omniscient, hath suppressed in night;<br/>

To none communicable in Earth or Heaven:<br/>

Enough is left besides to search and know.<br/>

But knowledge is as food, and needs no less<br/>

Her temperance over appetite, to know<br/>

In measure what the mind may well contain;<br/>

Oppresses else with surfeit, and soon turns<br/>

Wisdom to folly, as nourishment to wind.<br/>

Know then, that, after Lucifer from Heaven<br/>

(So call him, brighter once amidst the host<br/>

Of Angels, than that star the stars among,)<br/>

Fell with his flaming legions through the deep<br/>

Into his place, and the great Son returned<br/>

Victorious with his Saints, the Omnipotent<br/>

Eternal Father from his throne beheld<br/>

Their multitude, and to his Son thus spake.<br/>

At least our envious Foe hath failed, who thought<br/>

All like himself rebellious, by whose aid<br/>

This inaccessible high strength, the seat<br/>

Of Deity supreme, us dispossessed,<br/>

He trusted to have seised, and into fraud<br/>

Drew many, whom their place knows here no more:<br/>

Yet far the greater part have kept, I see,<br/>

Their station; Heaven, yet populous, retains<br/>

Number sufficient to possess her realms<br/>

Though wide, and this high temple to frequent<br/>

With ministeries due, and solemn rites:<br/>

But, lest his heart exalt him in the harm<br/>

Already done, to have dispeopled Heaven,<br/>

My damage fondly deemed, I can repair<br/>

That detriment, if such it be to lose<br/>

Self-lost; and in a moment will create<br/>

Another world, out of one man a race<br/>

Of men innumerable, there to dwell,<br/>

Not here; till, by degrees of merit raised,<br/>

They open to themselves at length the way<br/>

Up hither, under long obedience tried;<br/>

And Earth be changed to Heaven, and Heaven to Earth,<br/>

One kingdom, joy and union without end.<br/>

Mean while inhabit lax, ye Powers of Heaven;<br/>

And thou my Word, begotten Son, by thee<br/>

This I perform; speak thou, and be it done!<br/>

My overshadowing Spirit and Might with thee<br/>

I send along; ride forth, and bid the Deep<br/>

Within appointed bounds be Heaven and Earth;<br/>

Boundless the Deep, because I Am who fill<br/>

Infinitude, nor vacuous the space.<br/>

Though I, uncircumscribed myself, retire,<br/>

And put not forth my goodness, which is free<br/>

To act or not, Necessity and Chance<br/>

Approach not me, and what I will is Fate.<br/>

So spake the Almighty, and to what he spake<br/>

His Word, the Filial Godhead, gave effect.<br/>

Immediate are the acts of God, more swift<br/>

Than time or motion, but to human ears<br/>

Cannot without process of speech be told,<br/>

So told as earthly notion can receive.<br/>

Great triumph and rejoicing was in Heaven,<br/>

When such was heard declared the Almighty's will;<br/>

Glory they sung to the Most High, good will<br/>

To future men, and in their dwellings peace;<br/>

Glory to Him, whose just avenging ire<br/>

Had driven out the ungodly from his sight<br/>

And the habitations of the just; to Him<br/>

Glory and praise, whose wisdom had ordained<br/>

Good out of evil to create; instead<br/>

Of Spirits malign, a better race to bring<br/>

Into their vacant room, and thence diffuse<br/>

His good to worlds and ages infinite.<br/>

So sang the Hierarchies:  Mean while the Son<br/>

On his great expedition now appeared,<br/>

Girt with Omnipotence, with radiance crowned<br/>

Of Majesty Divine; sapience and love<br/>

Immense, and all his Father in him shone.<br/>

About his chariot numberless were poured<br/>

Cherub, and Seraph, Potentates, and Thrones,<br/>

And Virtues, winged Spirits, and chariots winged<br/>

From the armoury of God; where stand of old<br/>

Myriads, between two brazen mountains lodged<br/>

Against a solemn day, harnessed at hand,<br/>

Celestial equipage; and now came forth<br/>

Spontaneous, for within them Spirit lived,<br/>

Attendant on their Lord:  Heaven opened wide<br/>

Her ever-during gates, harmonious sound<br/>

On golden hinges moving, to let forth<br/>

The King of Glory, in his powerful Word<br/>

And Spirit, coming to create new worlds.<br/>

On heavenly ground they stood; and from the shore<br/>

They viewed the vast immeasurable abyss<br/>

Outrageous as a sea, dark, wasteful, wild,<br/>

Up from the bottom turned by furious winds<br/>

And surging waves, as mountains, to assault<br/>

Heaven's highth, and with the center mix the pole.<br/>

Silence, ye troubled Waves, and thou Deep, peace,<br/>

Said then the Omnifick Word; your discord end!<br/>

Nor staid; but, on the wings of Cherubim<br/>

Uplifted, in paternal glory rode<br/>

Far into Chaos, and the world unborn;<br/>

For Chaos heard his voice:  Him all his train<br/>

Followed in bright procession, to behold<br/>

Creation, and the wonders of his might.<br/>

Then staid the fervid wheels, and in his hand<br/>

He took the golden compasses, prepared<br/>

In God's eternal store, to circumscribe<br/>

This universe, and all created things:<br/>

One foot he centered, and the other turned<br/>

Round through the vast profundity obscure;<br/>

And said, Thus far extend, thus far thy bounds,<br/>

This be thy just circumference, O World!<br/>

Thus God the Heaven created, thus the Earth,<br/>

Matter unformed and void:  Darkness profound<br/>

Covered the abyss: but on the watery calm<br/>

His brooding wings the Spirit of God outspread,<br/>

And vital virtue infused, and vital warmth<br/>

Throughout the fluid mass; but downward purged<br/>

The black tartareous cold infernal dregs,<br/>

Adverse to life: then founded, then conglobed<br/>

Like things to like; the rest to several place<br/>

Disparted, and between spun out the air;<br/>

And Earth self-balanced on her center hung.<br/>

Let there be light, said God; and forthwith Light<br/>

Ethereal, first of things, quintessence pure,<br/>

Sprung from the deep; and from her native east<br/>

To journey through the aery gloom began,<br/>

Sphered in a radiant cloud, for yet the sun<br/>

Was not; she in a cloudy tabernacle<br/>

Sojourned the while.  God saw the light was good;<br/>

And light from darkness by the hemisphere<br/>

Divided: light the Day, and darkness Night,<br/>

He named.  Thus was the first day even and morn:<br/>

Nor past uncelebrated, nor unsung<br/>

By the celestial quires, when orient light<br/>

Exhaling first from darkness they beheld;<br/>

Birth-day of Heaven and Earth; with joy and shout<br/>

The hollow universal orb they filled,<br/>

And touched their golden harps, and hymning praised<br/>

God and his works; Creator him they sung,<br/>

Both when first evening was, and when first morn.<br/>

Again, God said,  Let there be firmament<br/>

Amid the waters, and let it divide<br/>

The waters from the waters; and God made<br/>

The firmament, expanse of liquid, pure,<br/>

Transparent, elemental air, diffused<br/>

In circuit to the uttermost convex<br/>

Of this great round; partition firm and sure,<br/>

The waters underneath from those above<br/>

Dividing: for as earth, so he the world<br/>

Built on circumfluous waters calm, in wide<br/>

Crystalline ocean, and the loud misrule<br/>

Of Chaos far removed; lest fierce extremes<br/>

Contiguous might distemper the whole frame:<br/>

And Heaven he named the Firmament:  So even<br/>

And morning chorus sung the second day.<br/>

The Earth was formed, but in the womb as yet<br/>

Of waters, embryon immature involved,<br/>

Appeared not: over all the face of Earth<br/>

Main ocean flowed, not idle; but, with warm<br/>

Prolifick humour softening all her globe,<br/>

Fermented the great mother to conceive,<br/>

Satiate with genial moisture; when God said,<br/>

Be gathered now ye waters under Heaven<br/>

Into one place, and let dry land appear.<br/>

Immediately the mountains huge appear<br/>

Emergent, and their broad bare backs upheave<br/>

Into the clouds; their tops ascend the sky:<br/>

So high as heaved the tumid hills, so low<br/>

Down sunk a hollow bottom broad and deep,<br/>

Capacious bed of waters:  Thither they<br/>

Hasted with glad precipitance, uprolled,<br/>

As drops on dust conglobing from the dry:<br/>

Part rise in crystal wall, or ridge direct,<br/>

For haste; such flight the great command impressed<br/>

On the swift floods:  As armies at the call<br/>

Of trumpet (for of armies thou hast heard)<br/>

Troop to their standard; so the watery throng,<br/>

Wave rolling after wave, where way they found,<br/>

If steep, with torrent rapture, if through plain,<br/>

Soft-ebbing; nor withstood them rock or hill;<br/>

But they, or under ground, or circuit wide<br/>

With serpent errour wandering, found their way,<br/>

And on the washy oose deep channels wore;<br/>

Easy, ere God had bid the ground be dry,<br/>

All but within those banks, where rivers now<br/>

Stream, and perpetual draw their humid train.<br/>

The dry land, Earth; and the great receptacle<br/>

Of congregated waters, he called Seas:<br/>

And saw that it was good; and said, Let the Earth<br/>

Put forth the verdant grass, herb yielding seed,<br/>

And fruit-tree yielding fruit after her kind,<br/>

Whose seed is in herself upon the Earth.<br/>

He scarce had said, when the bare Earth, till then<br/>

Desart and bare, unsightly, unadorned,<br/>

Brought forth the tender grass, whose verdure clad<br/>

Her universal face with pleasant green;<br/>

Then herbs of every leaf, that sudden flowered<br/>

Opening their various colours, and made gay<br/>

Her bosom, smelling sweet: and, these scarce blown,<br/>

Forth flourished thick the clustering vine, forth crept<br/>

The swelling gourd, up stood the corny reed<br/>

Embattled in her field, and the humble shrub,<br/>

And bush with frizzled hair implicit:  Last<br/>

Rose, as in dance, the stately trees, and spread<br/>

Their branches hung with copious fruit, or gemmed<br/>

Their blossoms:  With high woods the hills were crowned;<br/>

With tufts the valleys, and each fountain side;<br/>

With borders long the rivers: that Earth now<br/>

Seemed like to Heaven, a seat where Gods might dwell,<br/>

Or wander with delight, and love to haunt<br/>

Her sacred shades: though God had yet not rained<br/>

Upon the Earth, and man to till the ground<br/>

None was; but from the Earth a dewy mist<br/>

Went up, and watered all the ground, and each<br/>

Plant of the field; which, ere it was in the Earth,<br/>

God made, and every herb, before it grew<br/>

On the green stem:  God saw that it was good:<br/>

So even and morn recorded the third day.<br/>

Again the Almighty spake, Let there be lights<br/>

High in the expanse of Heaven, to divide<br/>

The day from night; and let them be for signs,<br/>

For seasons, and for days, and circling years;<br/>

And let them be for lights, as I ordain<br/>

Their office in the firmament of Heaven,<br/>

To give light on the Earth; and it was so.<br/>

And God made two great lights, great for their use<br/>

To Man, the greater to have rule by day,<br/>

The less by night, altern; and made the stars,<br/>

And set them in the firmament of Heaven<br/>

To illuminate the Earth, and rule the day<br/>

In their vicissitude, and rule the night,<br/>

And light from darkness to divide.  God saw,<br/>

Surveying his great work, that it was good:<br/>

For of celestial bodies first the sun<br/>

A mighty sphere he framed, unlightsome first,<br/>

Though of ethereal mould: then formed the moon<br/>

Globose, and every magnitude of stars,<br/>

And sowed with stars the Heaven, thick as a field:<br/>

Of light by far the greater part he took,<br/>

Transplanted from her cloudy shrine, and placed<br/>

In the sun's orb, made porous to receive<br/>

And drink the liquid light; firm to retain<br/>

Her gathered beams, great palace now of light.<br/>

Hither, as to their fountain, other stars<br/>

Repairing, in their golden urns draw light,<br/>

And hence the morning-planet gilds her horns;<br/>

By tincture or reflection they augment<br/>

Their small peculiar, though from human sight<br/>

So far remote, with diminution seen,<br/>

First in his east the glorious lamp was seen,<br/>

Regent of day, and all the horizon round<br/>

Invested with bright rays, jocund to run<br/>

His longitude through Heaven's high road; the gray<br/>

Dawn, and the Pleiades, before him danced,<br/>

Shedding sweet influence:  Less bright the moon,<br/>

But opposite in levelled west was set,<br/>

His mirrour, with full face borrowing her light<br/>

From him; for other light she needed none<br/>

In that aspect, and still that distance keeps<br/>

Till night; then in the east her turn she shines,<br/>

Revolved on Heaven's great axle, and her reign<br/>

With thousand lesser lights dividual holds,<br/>

With thousand thousand stars, that then appeared<br/>

Spangling the hemisphere:  Then first adorned<br/>

With their bright luminaries that set and rose,<br/>

Glad evening and glad morn crowned the fourth day.<br/>

And God said, Let the waters generate<br/>

Reptile with spawn abundant, living soul:<br/>

And let fowl fly above the Earth, with wings<br/>

Displayed on the open firmament of Heaven.<br/>

And God created the great whales, and each<br/>

Soul living, each that crept, which plenteously<br/>

The waters generated by their kinds;<br/>

And every bird of wing after his kind;<br/>

And saw that it was good, and blessed them, saying.<br/>

Be fruitful, multiply, and in the seas,<br/>

And lakes, and running streams, the waters fill;<br/>

And let the fowl be multiplied, on the Earth.<br/>

Forthwith the sounds and seas, each creek and bay,<br/>

With fry innumerable swarm, and shoals<br/>

Of fish that with their fins, and shining scales,<br/>

Glide under the green wave, in sculls that oft<br/>

Bank the mid sea: part single, or with mate,<br/>

Graze the sea-weed their pasture, and through groves<br/>

Of coral stray; or, sporting with quick glance,<br/>

Show to the sun their waved coats dropt with gold;<br/>

Or, in their pearly shells at ease, attend<br/>

Moist nutriment; or under rocks their food<br/>

In jointed armour watch: on smooth the seal<br/>

And bended dolphins play: part huge of bulk<br/>

Wallowing unwieldy, enormous in their gait,<br/>

Tempest the ocean: there leviathan,<br/>

Hugest of living creatures, on the deep<br/>

Stretched like a promontory sleeps or swims,<br/>

And seems a moving land; and at his gills<br/>

Draws in, and at his trunk spouts out, a sea.<br/>

Mean while the tepid caves, and fens, and shores,<br/>

Their brood as numerous hatch, from the egg that soon<br/>

Bursting with kindly rupture forth disclosed<br/>

Their callow young; but feathered soon and fledge<br/>

They summed their pens; and, soaring the air sublime,<br/>

With clang despised the ground, under a cloud<br/>

In prospect; there the eagle and the stork<br/>

On cliffs and cedar tops their eyries build:<br/>

Part loosely wing the region, part more wise<br/>

In common, ranged in figure, wedge their way,<br/>

Intelligent of seasons, and set forth<br/>

Their aery caravan, high over seas<br/>

Flying, and over lands, with mutual wing<br/>

Easing their flight; so steers the prudent crane<br/>

Her annual voyage, borne on winds; the air<br/>

Floats as they pass, fanned with unnumbered plumes:<br/>

From branch to branch the smaller birds with song<br/>

Solaced the woods, and spread their painted wings<br/>

Till even; nor then the solemn nightingale<br/>

Ceased warbling, but all night tun'd her soft lays:<br/>

Others, on silver lakes and rivers, bathed<br/>

Their downy breast; the swan with arched neck,<br/>

Between her white wings mantling proudly, rows<br/>

Her state with oary feet; yet oft they quit<br/>

The dank, and, rising on stiff pennons, tower<br/>

The mid aereal sky:  Others on ground<br/>

Walked firm; the crested cock whose clarion sounds<br/>

The silent hours, and the other whose gay train<br/>

Adorns him, coloured with the florid hue<br/>

Of rainbows and starry eyes.  The waters thus<br/>

With fish replenished, and the air with fowl,<br/>

Evening and morn solemnized the fifth day.<br/>

The sixth, and of creation last, arose<br/>

With evening harps and matin; when God said,<br/>

Let the Earth bring forth soul living in her kind,<br/>

Cattle, and creeping things, and beast of the Earth,<br/>

Each in their kind.  The Earth obeyed, and straight<br/>

Opening her fertile womb teemed at a birth<br/>

Innumerous living creatures, perfect forms,<br/>

Limbed and full grown:  Out of the ground up rose,<br/>

As from his lair, the wild beast where he wons<br/>

In forest wild, in thicket, brake, or den;<br/>

Among the trees in pairs they rose, they walked:<br/>

The cattle in the fields and meadows green:<br/>

Those rare and solitary, these in flocks<br/>

Pasturing at once, and in broad herds upsprung.<br/>

The grassy clods now calved; now half appeared<br/>

The tawny lion, pawing to get free<br/>

His hinder parts, then springs as broke from bonds,<br/>

And rampant shakes his brinded mane; the ounce,<br/>

The libbard, and the tiger, as the mole<br/>

Rising, the crumbled earth above them threw<br/>

In hillocks:  The swift stag from under ground<br/>

Bore up his branching head:  Scarce from his mould<br/>

Behemoth biggest born of earth upheaved<br/>

His vastness:  Fleeced the flocks and bleating rose,<br/>

As plants:  Ambiguous between sea and land<br/>

The river-horse, and scaly crocodile.<br/>

At once came forth whatever creeps the ground,<br/>

Insect or worm: those waved their limber fans<br/>

For wings, and smallest lineaments exact<br/>

In all the liveries decked of summer's pride<br/>

With spots of gold and purple, azure and green:<br/>

These, as a line, their long dimension drew,<br/>

Streaking the ground with sinuous trace; not all<br/>

Minims of nature; some of serpent-kind,<br/>

Wonderous in length and corpulence, involved<br/>

Their snaky folds, and added wings.  First crept<br/>

The parsimonious emmet, provident<br/>

Of future; in small room large heart enclosed;<br/>

Pattern of just equality perhaps<br/>

Hereafter, joined in her popular tribes<br/>

Of commonalty:  Swarming next appeared<br/>

The female bee, that feeds her husband drone<br/>

Deliciously, and builds her waxen cells<br/>

With honey stored:  The rest are numberless,<br/>

And thou their natures knowest, and gavest them names,<br/>

Needless to thee repeated; nor unknown<br/>

The serpent, subtlest beast of all the field,<br/>

Of huge extent sometimes, with brazen eyes<br/>

And hairy mane terrifick, though to thee<br/>

Not noxious, but obedient at thy call.<br/>

Now Heaven in all her glory shone, and rolled<br/>

Her motions, as the great first Mover's hand<br/>

First wheeled their course:  Earth in her rich attire<br/>

Consummate lovely smiled; air, water, earth,<br/>

By fowl, fish, beast, was flown, was swum, was walked,<br/>

Frequent; and of the sixth day yet remained:<br/>

There wanted yet the master-work, the end<br/>

Of all yet done; a creature, who, not prone<br/>

And brute as other creatures, but endued<br/>

With sanctity of reason, might erect<br/>

His stature, and upright with front serene<br/>

Govern the rest, self-knowing; and from thence<br/>

Magnanimous to correspond with Heaven,<br/>

But grateful to acknowledge whence his good<br/>

Descends, thither with heart, and voice, and eyes<br/>

Directed in devotion, to adore<br/>

And worship God Supreme, who made him chief<br/>

Of all his works:  therefore the Omnipotent<br/>

Eternal Father (for where is not he<br/>

Present?) thus to his Son audibly spake.<br/>

Let us make now Man in our image, Man<br/>

In our similitude, and let them rule<br/>

Over the fish and fowl of sea and air,<br/>

Beast of the field, and over all the Earth,<br/>

And every creeping thing that creeps the ground.<br/>

This said, he formed thee, Adam, thee, O Man,<br/>

Dust of the ground, and in thy nostrils breathed<br/>

The breath of life; in his own image he<br/>

Created thee, in the image of God<br/>

Express; and thou becamest a living soul.<br/>

Male he created thee; but thy consort<br/>

Female, for race; then blessed mankind, and said,<br/>

Be fruitful, multiply, and fill the Earth;<br/>

Subdue it, and throughout dominion hold<br/>

Over fish of the sea, and fowl of the air,<br/>

And every living thing that moves on the Earth.<br/>

Wherever thus created, for no place<br/>

Is yet distinct by name, thence, as thou knowest,<br/>

He brought thee into this delicious grove,<br/>

This garden, planted with the trees of God,<br/>

Delectable both to behold and taste;<br/>

And freely all their pleasant fruit for food<br/>

Gave thee; all sorts are here that all the Earth yields,<br/>

Variety without end; but of the tree,<br/>

Which, tasted, works knowledge of good and evil,<br/>

Thou mayest not; in the day thou eatest, thou diest;<br/>

Death is the penalty imposed; beware,<br/>

And govern well thy appetite; lest Sin<br/>

Surprise thee, and her black attendant Death.<br/>

Here finished he, and all that he had made<br/>

Viewed, and behold all was entirely good;<br/>

So even and morn accomplished the sixth day:<br/>

Yet not till the Creator from his work<br/>

Desisting, though unwearied, up returned,<br/>

Up to the Heaven of Heavens, his high abode;<br/>

Thence to behold this new created world,<br/>

The addition of his empire, how it showed<br/>

In prospect from his throne, how good, how fair,<br/>

Answering his great idea.  Up he rode<br/>

Followed with acclamation, and the sound<br/>

Symphonious of ten thousand harps, that tuned<br/>

Angelick harmonies:  The earth, the air<br/>

Resounded, (thou rememberest, for thou heardst,)<br/>

The heavens and all the constellations rung,<br/>

The planets in their station listening stood,<br/>

While the bright pomp ascended jubilant.<br/>

Open, ye everlasting gates! they sung,<br/>

Open, ye Heavens! your living doors; let in<br/>

The great Creator from his work returned<br/>

Magnificent, his six days work, a World;<br/>

Open, and henceforth oft; for God will deign<br/>

To visit oft the dwellings of just men,<br/>

Delighted; and with frequent intercourse<br/>

Thither will send his winged messengers<br/>

On errands of supernal grace.  So sung<br/>

The glorious train ascending:  He through Heaven,<br/>

That opened wide her blazing portals, led<br/>

To God's eternal house direct the way;<br/>

A broad and ample road, whose dust is gold<br/>

And pavement stars, as stars to thee appear,<br/>

Seen in the galaxy, that milky way,<br/>

Which nightly, as a circling zone, thou seest<br/>

Powdered with stars.  And now on Earth the seventh<br/>

Evening arose in Eden, for the sun<br/>

Was set, and twilight from the east came on,<br/>

Forerunning night; when at the holy mount<br/>

Of Heaven's high-seated top, the imperial throne<br/>

Of Godhead, fixed for ever firm and sure,<br/>

The Filial Power arrived, and sat him down<br/>

With his great Father; for he also went<br/>

Invisible, yet staid, (such privilege<br/>

Hath Omnipresence) and the work ordained,<br/>

Author and End of all things; and, from work<br/>

Now resting, blessed and hallowed the seventh day,<br/>

As resting on that day from all his work,<br/>

But not in silence holy kept: the harp<br/>

Had work and rested not; the solemn pipe,<br/>

And dulcimer, all organs of sweet stop,<br/>

All sounds on fret by string or golden wire,<br/>

Tempered soft tunings, intermixed with voice<br/>

Choral or unison: of incense clouds,<br/>

Fuming from golden censers, hid the mount.<br/>

Creation and the six days acts they sung:<br/>

Great are thy works, Jehovah! infinite<br/>

Thy power! what thought can measure thee, or tongue<br/>

Relate thee!  Greater now in thy return<br/>

Than from the giant Angels:  Thee that day<br/>

Thy thunders magnified; but to create<br/>

Is greater than created to destroy.<br/>

Who can impair thee, Mighty King, or bound<br/>

Thy empire!  Easily the proud attempt<br/>

Of Spirits apostate, and their counsels vain,<br/>

Thou hast repelled; while impiously they thought<br/>

Thee to diminish, and from thee withdraw<br/>

The number of thy worshippers.  Who seeks<br/>

To lessen thee, against his purpose serves<br/>

To manifest the more thy might: his evil<br/>

Thou usest, and from thence createst more good.<br/>

Witness this new-made world, another Heaven<br/>

From Heaven-gate not far, founded in view<br/>

On the clear hyaline, the glassy sea;<br/>

Of amplitude almost immense, with stars<br/>

Numerous, and every star perhaps a world<br/>

Of destined habitation; but thou knowest<br/>

Their seasons: among these the seat of Men,<br/>

Earth, with her nether ocean circumfused,<br/>

Their pleasant dwelling-place.  Thrice happy Men,<br/>

And sons of Men, whom God hath thus advanced!<br/>

Created in his image, there to dwell<br/>

And worship him; and in reward to rule<br/>

Over his works, on earth, in sea, or air,<br/>

And multiply a race of worshippers<br/>

Holy and just:  Thrice happy, if they know<br/>

Their happiness, and persevere upright!<br/>

So sung they, and the empyrean rung<br/>

With halleluiahs:  Thus was sabbath kept.<br/>

And thy request think now fulfilled, that asked<br/>

How first this world and face of things began,<br/>

And what before thy memory was done<br/>

From the beginning; that posterity,<br/>

Informed by thee, might know:  If else thou seekest<br/>

Aught, not surpassing human measure, say.<br/>
</p>
<h3 id="id00030" style="margin-top: 3em">Book VIII</h3>
<p id="id00031" style="margin-top: 2em">The Angel ended, and in Adam's ear<br/>

So charming left his voice, that he a while<br/>

Thought him still speaking, still stood fixed to hear;<br/>

Then, as new waked, thus gratefully replied.<br/>

What thanks sufficient, or what recompence<br/>

Equal, have I to render thee, divine<br/>

Historian, who thus largely hast allayed<br/>

The thirst I had of knowledge, and vouchsafed<br/>

This friendly condescension to relate<br/>

Things, else by me unsearchable; now heard<br/>

With wonder, but delight, and, as is due,<br/>

With glory attributed to the high<br/>

Creator!  Something yet of doubt remains,<br/>

Which only thy solution can resolve.<br/>

When I behold this goodly frame, this world,<br/>

Of Heaven and Earth consisting; and compute<br/>

Their magnitudes; this Earth, a spot, a grain,<br/>

An atom, with the firmament compared<br/>

And all her numbered stars, that seem to roll<br/>

Spaces incomprehensible, (for such<br/>

Their distance argues, and their swift return<br/>

Diurnal,) merely to officiate light<br/>

Round this opacous Earth, this punctual spot,<br/>

One day and night; in all her vast survey<br/>

Useless besides; reasoning I oft admire,<br/>

How Nature wise and frugal could commit<br/>

Such disproportions, with superfluous hand<br/>

So many nobler bodies to create,<br/>

Greater so manifold, to this one use,<br/>

For aught appears, and on their orbs impose<br/>

Such restless revolution day by day<br/>

Repeated; while the sedentary Earth,<br/>

That better might with far less compass move,<br/>

Served by more noble than herself, attains<br/>

Her end without least motion, and receives,<br/>

As tribute, such a sumless journey brought<br/>

Of incorporeal speed, her warmth and light;<br/>

Speed, to describe whose swiftness number fails.<br/>

So spake our sire, and by his countenance seemed<br/>

Entering on studious thoughts abstruse; which Eve<br/>

Perceiving, where she sat retired in sight,<br/>

With lowliness majestick from her seat,<br/>

And grace that won who saw to wish her stay,<br/>

Rose, and went forth among her fruits and flowers,<br/>

To visit how they prospered, bud and bloom,<br/>

Her nursery; they at her coming sprung,<br/>

And, touched by her fair tendance, gladlier grew.<br/>

Yet went she not, as not with such discourse<br/>

Delighted, or not capable her ear<br/>

Of what was high: such pleasure she reserved,<br/>

Adam relating, she sole auditress;<br/>

Her husband the relater she preferred<br/>

Before the Angel, and of him to ask<br/>

Chose rather; he, she knew, would intermix<br/>

Grateful digressions, and solve high dispute<br/>

With conjugal caresses: from his lip<br/>

Not words alone pleased her.  O! when meet now<br/>

Such pairs, in love and mutual honour joined?<br/>

With Goddess-like demeanour forth she went,<br/>

Not unattended; for on her, as Queen,<br/>

A pomp of winning Graces waited still,<br/>

And from about her shot darts of desire<br/>

Into all eyes, to wish her still in sight.<br/>

And Raphael now, to Adam's doubt proposed,<br/>

Benevolent and facile thus replied.<br/>

To ask or search, I blame thee not; for Heaven<br/>

Is as the book of God before thee set,<br/>

Wherein to read his wonderous works, and learn<br/>

His seasons, hours, or days, or months, or years:<br/>

This to attain, whether Heaven move or Earth,<br/>

Imports not, if thou reckon right; the rest<br/>

From Man or Angel the great Architect<br/>

Did wisely to conceal, and not divulge<br/>

His secrets to be scanned by them who ought<br/>

Rather admire; or, if they list to try<br/>

Conjecture, he his fabrick of the Heavens<br/>

Hath left to their disputes, perhaps to move<br/>

His laughter at their quaint opinions wide<br/>

Hereafter; when they come to model Heaven<br/>

And calculate the stars, how they will wield<br/>

The mighty frame; how build, unbuild, contrive<br/>

To save appearances; how gird the sphere<br/>

With centrick and eccentrick scribbled o'er,<br/>

Cycle and epicycle, orb in orb:<br/>

Already by thy reasoning this I guess,<br/>

Who art to lead thy offspring, and supposest<br/>

That bodies bright and greater should not serve<br/>

The less not bright, nor Heaven such journeys run,<br/>

Earth sitting still, when she alone receives<br/>

The benefit:  Consider first, that great<br/>

Or bright infers not excellence: the Earth<br/>

Though, in comparison of Heaven, so small,<br/>

Nor glistering, may of solid good contain<br/>

More plenty than the sun that barren shines;<br/>

Whose virtue on itself works no effect,<br/>

But in the fruitful Earth; there first received,<br/>

His beams, unactive else, their vigour find.<br/>

Yet not to Earth are those bright luminaries<br/>

Officious; but to thee, Earth's habitant.<br/>

And for the Heaven's wide circuit, let it speak<br/>

The Maker's high magnificence, who built<br/>

So spacious, and his line stretched out so far;<br/>

That Man may know he dwells not in his own;<br/>

An edifice too large for him to fill,<br/>

Lodged in a small partition; and the rest<br/>

Ordained for uses to his Lord best known.<br/>

The swiftness of those circles attribute,<br/>

Though numberless, to his Omnipotence,<br/>

That to corporeal substances could add<br/>

Speed almost spiritual:  Me thou thinkest not slow,<br/>

Who since the morning-hour set out from Heaven<br/>

Where God resides, and ere mid-day arrived<br/>

In Eden; distance inexpressible<br/>

By numbers that have name.  But this I urge,<br/>

Admitting motion in the Heavens, to show<br/>

Invalid that which thee to doubt it moved;<br/>

Not that I so affirm, though so it seem<br/>

To thee who hast thy dwelling here on Earth.<br/>

God, to remove his ways from human sense,<br/>

Placed Heaven from Earth so far, that earthly sight,<br/>

If it presume, might err in things too high,<br/>

And no advantage gain.  What if the sun<br/>

Be center to the world; and other stars,<br/>

By his attractive virtue and their own<br/>

Incited, dance about him various rounds?<br/>

Their wandering course now high, now low, then hid,<br/>

Progressive, retrograde, or standing still,<br/>

In six thou seest; and what if seventh to these<br/>

The planet earth, so stedfast though she seem,<br/>

Insensibly three different motions move?<br/>

Which else to several spheres thou must ascribe,<br/>

Moved contrary with thwart obliquities;<br/>

Or save the sun his labour, and that swift<br/>

Nocturnal and diurnal rhomb supposed,<br/>

Invisible else above all stars, the wheel<br/>

Of day and night; which needs not thy belief,<br/>

If earth, industrious of herself, fetch day<br/>

Travelling east, and with her part averse<br/>

From the sun's beam meet night, her other part<br/>

Still luminous by his ray.  What if that light,<br/>

Sent from her through the wide transpicuous air,<br/>

To the terrestrial moon be as a star,<br/>

Enlightening her by day, as she by night<br/>

This earth? reciprocal, if land be there,<br/>

Fields and inhabitants:  Her spots thou seest<br/>

As clouds, and clouds may rain, and rain produce<br/>

Fruits in her softened soil for some to eat<br/>

Allotted there; and other suns perhaps,<br/>

With their attendant moons, thou wilt descry,<br/>

Communicating male and female light;<br/>

Which two great sexes animate the world,<br/>

Stored in each orb perhaps with some that live.<br/>

For such vast room in Nature unpossessed<br/>

By living soul, desart and desolate,<br/>

Only to shine, yet scarce to contribute<br/>

Each orb a glimpse of light, conveyed so far<br/>

Down to this habitable, which returns<br/>

Light back to them, is obvious to dispute.<br/>

But whether thus these things, or whether not;<br/>

But whether the sun, predominant in Heaven,<br/>

Rise on the earth; or earth rise on the sun;<br/>

He from the east his flaming road begin;<br/>

Or she from west her silent course advance,<br/>

With inoffensive pace that spinning sleeps<br/>

On her soft axle, while she paces even,<br/>

And bears thee soft with the smooth hair along;<br/>

Sollicit not thy thoughts with matters hid;<br/>

Leave them to God above; him serve, and fear!<br/>

Of other creatures, as him pleases best,<br/>

Wherever placed, let him dispose; joy thou<br/>

In what he gives to thee, this Paradise<br/>

And thy fair Eve; Heaven is for thee too high<br/>

To know what passes there; be lowly wise:<br/>

Think only what concerns thee, and thy being;<br/>

Dream not of other worlds, what creatures there<br/>

Live, in what state, condition, or degree;<br/>

Contented that thus far hath been revealed<br/>

Not of Earth only, but of highest Heaven.<br/>

To whom thus Adam, cleared of doubt, replied.<br/>

How fully hast thou satisfied me, pure<br/>

Intelligence of Heaven, Angel serene!<br/>

And, freed from intricacies, taught to live<br/>

The easiest way; nor with perplexing thoughts<br/>

To interrupt the sweet of life, from which<br/>

God hath bid dwell far off all anxious cares,<br/>

And not molest us; unless we ourselves<br/>

Seek them with wandering thoughts, and notions vain.<br/>

But apt the mind or fancy is to rove<br/>

Unchecked, and of her roving is no end;<br/>

Till warned, or by experience taught, she learn,<br/>

That, not to know at large of things remote<br/>

From use, obscure and subtle; but, to know<br/>

That which before us lies in daily life,<br/>

Is the prime wisdom:  What is more, is fume,<br/>

Or emptiness, or fond impertinence:<br/>

And renders us, in things that most concern,<br/>

Unpractised, unprepared, and still to seek.<br/>

Therefore from this high pitch let us descend<br/>

A lower flight, and speak of things at hand<br/>

Useful; whence, haply, mention may arise<br/>

Of something not unseasonable to ask,<br/>

By sufferance, and thy wonted favour, deigned.<br/>

Thee I have heard relating what was done<br/>

Ere my remembrance: now, hear me relate<br/>

My story, which perhaps thou hast not heard;<br/>

And day is not yet spent; till then thou seest<br/>

How subtly to detain thee I devise;<br/>

Inviting thee to hear while I relate;<br/>

Fond! were it not in hope of thy reply:<br/>

For, while I sit with thee, I seem in Heaven;<br/>

And sweeter thy discourse is to my ear<br/>

Than fruits of palm-tree pleasantest to thirst<br/>

And hunger both, from labour, at the hour<br/>

Of sweet repast; they satiate, and soon fill,<br/>

Though pleasant; but thy words, with grace divine<br/>

Imbued, bring to their sweetness no satiety.<br/>

To whom thus Raphael answered heavenly meek.<br/>

Nor are thy lips ungraceful, Sire of men,<br/>

Nor tongue ineloquent; for God on thee<br/>

Abundantly his gifts hath also poured<br/>

Inward and outward both, his image fair:<br/>

Speaking, or mute, all comeliness and grace<br/>

Attends thee; and each word, each motion, forms;<br/>

Nor less think we in Heaven of thee on Earth<br/>

Than of our fellow-servant, and inquire<br/>

Gladly into the ways of God with Man:<br/>

For God, we see, hath honoured thee, and set<br/>

On Man his equal love:  Say therefore on;<br/>

For I that day was absent, as befel,<br/>

Bound on a voyage uncouth and obscure,<br/>

Far on excursion toward the gates of Hell;<br/>

Squared in full legion (such command we had)<br/>

To see that none thence issued forth a spy,<br/>

Or enemy, while God was in his work;<br/>

Lest he, incensed at such eruption bold,<br/>

Destruction with creation might have mixed.<br/>

Not that they durst without his leave attempt;<br/>

But us he sends upon his high behests<br/>

For state, as Sovran King; and to inure<br/>

Our prompt obedience.  Fast we found, fast shut,<br/>

The dismal gates, and barricadoed strong;<br/>

But long ere our approaching heard within<br/>

Noise, other than the sound of dance or song,<br/>

Torment, and loud lament, and furious rage.<br/>

Glad we returned up to the coasts of light<br/>

Ere sabbath-evening: so we had in charge.<br/>

But thy relation now; for I attend,<br/>

Pleased with thy words no less than thou with mine.<br/>

So spake the Godlike Power, and thus our Sire.<br/>

For Man to tell how human life began<br/>

Is hard; for who himself beginning knew<br/>

Desire with thee still longer to converse<br/>

Induced me.  As new waked from soundest sleep,<br/>

Soft on the flowery herb I found me laid,<br/>

In balmy sweat; which with his beams the sun<br/>

Soon dried, and on the reeking moisture fed.<br/>

Straight toward Heaven my wondering eyes I turned,<br/>

And gazed a while the ample sky; till, raised<br/>

By quick instinctive motion, up I sprung,<br/>

As thitherward endeavouring, and upright<br/>

Stood on my feet: about me round I saw<br/>

Hill, dale, and shady woods, and sunny plains,<br/>

And liquid lapse of murmuring streams; by these,<br/>

Creatures that lived and moved, and walked, or flew;<br/>

Birds on the branches warbling; all things smiled;<br/>

With fragrance and with joy my heart o'erflowed.<br/>

Myself I then perused, and limb by limb<br/>

Surveyed, and sometimes went, and sometimes ran<br/>

With supple joints, as lively vigour led:<br/>

But who I was, or where, or from what cause,<br/>

Knew not; to speak I tried, and forthwith spake;<br/>

My tongue obeyed, and readily could name<br/>

Whate'er I saw.  Thou Sun, said I, fair light,<br/>

And thou enlightened Earth, so fresh and gay,<br/>

Ye Hills, and Dales, ye Rivers, Woods, and Plains,<br/>

And ye that live and move, fair Creatures, tell,<br/>

Tell, if ye saw, how I came thus, how here?—<br/>

Not of myself;—by some great Maker then,<br/>

In goodness and in power pre-eminent:<br/>

Tell me, how may I know him, how adore,<br/>

From whom I have that thus I move and live,<br/>

And feel that I am happier than I know.—<br/>

While thus I called, and strayed I knew not whither,<br/>

From where I first drew air, and first beheld<br/>

This happy light; when, answer none returned,<br/>

On a green shady bank, profuse of flowers,<br/>

Pensive I sat me down:  There gentle sleep<br/>

First found me, and with soft oppression seised<br/>

My droused sense, untroubled, though I thought<br/>

I then was passing to my former state<br/>

Insensible, and forthwith to dissolve:<br/>

When suddenly stood at my head a dream,<br/>

Whose inward apparition gently moved<br/>

My fancy to believe I yet had being,<br/>

And lived:  One came, methought, of shape divine,<br/>

And said, "Thy mansion wants thee, Adam; rise,<br/>

First Man, of men innumerable ordained<br/>

First Father! called by thee, I come thy guide<br/>

To the garden of bliss, thy seat prepared."<br/>

So saying, by the hand he took me raised,<br/>

And over fields and waters, as in air<br/>

Smooth-sliding without step, last led me up<br/>

A woody mountain; whose high top was plain,<br/>

A circuit wide, enclosed, with goodliest trees<br/>

Planted, with walks, and bowers; that what I saw<br/>

Of Earth before scarce pleasant seemed.  Each tree,<br/>

Loaden with fairest fruit that hung to the eye<br/>

Tempting, stirred in me sudden appetite<br/>

To pluck and eat; whereat I waked, and found<br/>

Before mine eyes all real, as the dream<br/>

Had lively shadowed:  Here had new begun<br/>

My wandering, had not he, who was my guide<br/>

Up hither, from among the trees appeared,<br/>

Presence Divine.  Rejoicing, but with awe,<br/>

In adoration at his feet I fell<br/>

Submiss:  He reared me, and "Whom thou soughtest I am,"<br/>

Said mildly, "Author of all this thou seest<br/>

Above, or round about thee, or beneath.<br/>

This Paradise I give thee, count it thine<br/>

To till and keep, and of the fruit to eat:<br/>

Of every tree that in the garden grows<br/>

Eat freely with glad heart; fear here no dearth:<br/>

But of the tree whose operation brings<br/>

Knowledge of good and ill, which I have set<br/>

The pledge of thy obedience and thy faith,<br/>

Amid the garden by the tree of life,<br/>

Remember what I warn thee, shun to taste,<br/>

And shun the bitter consequence: for know,<br/>

The day thou eatest thereof, my sole command<br/>

Transgressed, inevitably thou shalt die,<br/>

From that day mortal; and this happy state<br/>

Shalt lose, expelled from hence into a world<br/>

Of woe and sorrow."  Sternly he pronounced<br/>

The rigid interdiction, which resounds<br/>

Yet dreadful in mine ear, though in my choice<br/>

Not to incur; but soon his clear aspect<br/>

Returned, and gracious purpose thus renewed.<br/>

"Not only these fair bounds, but all the Earth<br/>

To thee and to thy race I give; as lords<br/>

Possess it, and all things that therein live,<br/>

Or live in sea, or air; beast, fish, and fowl.<br/>

In sign whereof, each bird and beast behold<br/>

After their kinds; I bring them to receive<br/>

From thee their names, and pay thee fealty<br/>

With low subjection; understand the same<br/>

Of fish within their watery residence,<br/>

Not hither summoned, since they cannot change<br/>

Their element, to draw the thinner air."<br/>

As thus he spake, each bird and beast behold<br/>

Approaching two and two; these cowering low<br/>

With blandishment; each bird stooped on his wing.<br/>

I named them, as they passed, and understood<br/>

Their nature, with such knowledge God endued<br/>

My sudden apprehension:  But in these<br/>

I found not what methought I wanted still;<br/>

And to the heavenly Vision thus presumed.<br/>

O, by what name, for thou above all these,<br/>

Above mankind, or aught than mankind higher,<br/>

Surpassest far my naming; how may I<br/>

Adore thee, Author of this universe,<br/>

And all this good to man? for whose well being<br/>

So amply, and with hands so liberal,<br/>

Thou hast provided all things:  But with me<br/>

I see not who partakes.  In solitude<br/>

What happiness, who can enjoy alone,<br/>

Or, all enjoying, what contentment find?<br/>

Thus I presumptuous; and the Vision bright,<br/>

As with a smile more brightened, thus replied.<br/>

What callest thou solitude?  Is not the Earth<br/>

With various living creatures, and the air<br/>

Replenished, and all these at thy command<br/>

To come and play before thee?  Knowest thou not<br/>

Their language and their ways?  They also know,<br/>

And reason not contemptibly:  With these<br/>

Find pastime, and bear rule; thy realm is large.<br/>

So spake the Universal Lord, and seemed<br/>

So ordering:  I, with leave of speech implored,<br/>

And humble deprecation, thus replied.<br/>

Let not my words offend thee, Heavenly Power;<br/>

My Maker, be propitious while I speak.<br/>

Hast thou not made me here thy substitute,<br/>

And these inferiour far beneath me set?<br/>

Among unequals what society<br/>

Can sort, what harmony, or true delight?<br/>

Which must be mutual, in proportion due<br/>

Given and received; but, in disparity<br/>

The one intense, the other still remiss,<br/>

Cannot well suit with either, but soon prove<br/>

Tedious alike:  Of fellowship I speak<br/>

Such as I seek, fit to participate<br/>

All rational delight: wherein the brute<br/>

Cannot be human consort:  They rejoice<br/>

Each with their kind, lion with lioness;<br/>

So fitly them in pairs thou hast combined:<br/>

Much less can bird with beast, or fish with fowl<br/>

So well converse, nor with the ox the ape;<br/>

Worse then can man with beast, and least of all.<br/>

Whereto the Almighty answered, not displeased.<br/>

A nice and subtle happiness, I see,<br/>

Thou to thyself proposest, in the choice<br/>

Of thy associates, Adam! and wilt taste<br/>

No pleasure, though in pleasure, solitary.<br/>

What thinkest thou then of me, and this my state?<br/>

Seem I to thee sufficiently possessed<br/>

Of happiness, or not? who am alone<br/>

From all eternity; for none I know<br/>

Second to me or like, equal much less.<br/>

How have I then with whom to hold converse,<br/>

Save with the creatures which I made, and those<br/>

To me inferiour, infinite descents<br/>

Beneath what other creatures are to thee?<br/>

He ceased; I lowly answered.  To attain<br/>

The highth and depth of thy eternal ways<br/>

All human thoughts come short, Supreme of things!<br/>

Thou in thyself art perfect, and in thee<br/>

Is no deficience found:  Not so is Man,<br/>

But in degree; the cause of his desire<br/>

By conversation with his like to help<br/>

Or solace his defects.  No need that thou<br/>

Shouldst propagate, already Infinite;<br/>

And through all numbers absolute, though One:<br/>

But Man by number is to manifest<br/>

His single imperfection, and beget<br/>

Like of his like, his image multiplied,<br/>

In unity defective; which requires<br/>

Collateral love, and dearest amity.<br/>

Thou in thy secresy although alone,<br/>

Best with thyself accompanied, seekest not<br/>

Social communication; yet, so pleased,<br/>

Canst raise thy creature to what highth thou wilt<br/>

Of union or communion, deified:<br/>

I, by conversing, cannot these erect<br/>

From prone; nor in their ways complacence find.<br/>

Thus I emboldened spake, and freedom used<br/>

Permissive, and acceptance found; which gained<br/>

This answer from the gracious Voice Divine.<br/>

Thus far to try thee, Adam, I was pleased;<br/>

And find thee knowing, not of beasts alone,<br/>

Which thou hast rightly named, but of thyself;<br/>

Expressing well the spirit within thee free,<br/>

My image, not imparted to the brute;<br/>

Whose fellowship therefore unmeet for thee<br/>

Good reason was thou freely shouldst dislike;<br/>

And be so minded still:  I, ere thou spakest,<br/>

Knew it not good for Man to be alone;<br/>

And no such company as then thou sawest<br/>

Intended thee; for trial only brought,<br/>

To see how thou couldest judge of fit and meet:<br/>

What next I bring shall please thee, be assured,<br/>

Thy likeness, thy fit help, thy other self,<br/>

Thy wish exactly to thy heart's desire.<br/>

He ended, or I heard no more; for now<br/>

My earthly by his heavenly overpowered,<br/>

Which it had long stood under, strained to the highth<br/>

In that celestial colloquy sublime,<br/>

As with an object that excels the sense<br/>

Dazzled and spent, sunk down; and sought repair<br/>

Of sleep, which instantly fell on me, called<br/>

By Nature as in aid, and closed mine eyes.<br/>

Mine eyes he closed, but open left the cell<br/>

Of fancy, my internal sight; by which,<br/>

Abstract as in a trance, methought I saw,<br/>

Though sleeping, where I lay, and saw the shape<br/>

Still glorious before whom awake I stood:<br/>

Who stooping opened my left side, and took<br/>

From thence a rib, with cordial spirits warm,<br/>

And life-blood streaming fresh; wide was the wound,<br/>

But suddenly with flesh filled up and healed:<br/>

The rib he formed and fashioned with his hands;<br/>

Under his forming hands a creature grew,<br/>

Man-like, but different sex; so lovely fair,<br/>

That what seemed fair in all the world, seemed now<br/>

Mean, or in her summed up, in her contained<br/>

And in her looks; which from that time infused<br/>

Sweetness into my heart, unfelt before,<br/>

And into all things from her air inspired<br/>

The spirit of love and amorous delight.<br/>

She disappeared, and left me dark; I waked<br/>

To find her, or for ever to deplore<br/>

Her loss, and other pleasures all abjure:<br/>

When out of hope, behold her, not far off,<br/>

Such as I saw her in my dream, adorned<br/>

With what all Earth or Heaven could bestow<br/>

To make her amiable:  On she came,<br/>

Led by her heavenly Maker, though unseen,<br/>

And guided by his voice; nor uninformed<br/>

Of nuptial sanctity, and marriage rites:<br/>

Grace was in all her steps, Heaven in her eye,<br/>

In every gesture dignity and love.<br/>

I, overjoyed, could not forbear aloud.<br/>

This turn hath made amends; thou hast fulfilled<br/>

Thy words, Creator bounteous and benign,<br/>

Giver of all things fair! but fairest this<br/>

Of all thy gifts! nor enviest.  I now see<br/>

Bone of my bone, flesh of my flesh, myself<br/>

Before me:  Woman is her name; of Man<br/>

Extracted: for this cause he shall forego<br/>

Father and mother, and to his wife adhere;<br/>

And they shall be one flesh, one heart, one soul.<br/>

She heard me thus; and though divinely brought,<br/>

Yet innocence, and virgin modesty,<br/>

Her virtue, and the conscience of her worth,<br/>

That would be wooed, and not unsought be won,<br/>

Not obvious, not obtrusive, but, retired,<br/>

The more desirable; or, to say all,<br/>

Nature herself, though pure of sinful thought,<br/>

Wrought in her so, that, seeing me, she turned:<br/>

I followed her; she what was honour knew,<br/>

And with obsequious majesty approved<br/>

My pleaded reason.  To the nuptial bower<br/>

I led her blushing like the morn: All Heaven,<br/>

And happy constellations, on that hour<br/>

Shed their selectest influence; the Earth<br/>

Gave sign of gratulation, and each hill;<br/>

Joyous the birds; fresh gales and gentle airs<br/>

Whispered it to the woods, and from their wings<br/>

Flung rose, flung odours from the spicy shrub,<br/>

Disporting, till the amorous bird of night<br/>

Sung spousal, and bid haste the evening-star<br/>

On his hill top, to light the bridal lamp.<br/>

Thus have I told thee all my state, and brought<br/>

My story to the sum of earthly bliss,<br/>

Which I enjoy; and must confess to find<br/>

In all things else delight indeed, but such<br/>

As, used or not, works in the mind no change,<br/>

Nor vehement desire; these delicacies<br/>

I mean of taste, sight, smell, herbs, fruits, and flowers,<br/>

Walks, and the melody of birds: but here<br/>

Far otherwise, transported I behold,<br/>

Transported touch; here passion first I felt,<br/>

Commotion strange! in all enjoyments else<br/>

Superiour and unmoved; here only weak<br/>

Against the charm of Beauty's powerful glance.<br/>

Or Nature failed in me, and left some part<br/>

Not proof enough such object to sustain;<br/>

Or, from my side subducting, took perhaps<br/>

More than enough; at least on her bestowed<br/>

Too much of ornament, in outward show<br/>

Elaborate, of inward less exact.<br/>

For well I understand in the prime end<br/>

Of Nature her the inferiour, in the mind<br/>

And inward faculties, which most excel;<br/>

In outward also her resembling less<br/>

His image who made both, and less expressing<br/>

The character of that dominion given<br/>

O'er other creatures:  Yet when I approach<br/>

Her loveliness, so absolute she seems<br/>

And in herself complete, so well to know<br/>

Her own, that what she wills to do or say,<br/>

Seems wisest, virtuousest, discreetest, best:<br/>

All higher knowledge in her presence falls<br/>

Degraded;  Wisdom in discourse with her<br/>

Loses discountenanced, and like Folly shows;<br/>

Authority and Reason on her wait,<br/>

As one intended first, not after made<br/>

Occasionally; and, to consummate all,<br/>

Greatness of mind and Nobleness their seat<br/>

Build in her loveliest, and create an awe<br/>

About her, as a guard angelick placed.<br/>

To whom the Angel with contracted brow.<br/>

Accuse not Nature, she hath done her part;<br/>

Do thou but thine; and be not diffident<br/>

Of Wisdom; she deserts thee not, if thou<br/>

Dismiss not her, when most thou needest her nigh,<br/>

By attributing overmuch to things<br/>

Less excellent, as thou thyself perceivest.<br/>

For, what admirest thou, what transports thee so,<br/>

An outside? fair, no doubt, and worthy well<br/>

Thy cherishing, thy honouring, and thy love;<br/>

Not thy subjection:  Weigh with her thyself;<br/>

Then value:  Oft-times nothing profits more<br/>

Than self-esteem, grounded on just and right<br/>

Well managed; of that skill the more thou knowest,<br/>

The more she will acknowledge thee her head,<br/>

And to realities yield all her shows:<br/>

Made so adorn for thy delight the more,<br/>

So awful, that with honour thou mayest love<br/>

Thy mate, who sees when thou art seen least wise.<br/>

But if the sense of touch, whereby mankind<br/>

Is propagated, seem such dear delight<br/>

Beyond all other; think the same vouchsafed<br/>

To cattle and each beast; which would not be<br/>

To them made common and divulged, if aught<br/>

Therein enjoyed were worthy to subdue<br/>

The soul of man, or passion in him move.<br/>

What higher in her society thou findest<br/>

Attractive, human, rational, love still;<br/>

In loving thou dost well, in passion not,<br/>

Wherein true love consists not:  Love refines<br/>

The thoughts, and heart enlarges; hath his seat<br/>

In reason, and is judicious; is the scale<br/>

By which to heavenly love thou mayest ascend,<br/>

Not sunk in carnal pleasure; for which cause,<br/>

Among the beasts no mate for thee was found.<br/>

To whom thus, half abashed, Adam replied.<br/>

Neither her outside formed so fair, nor aught<br/>

In procreation common to all kinds,<br/>

(Though higher of the genial bed by far,<br/>

And with mysterious reverence I deem,)<br/>

So much delights me, as those graceful acts,<br/>

Those thousand decencies, that daily flow<br/>

From all her words and actions mixed with love<br/>

And sweet compliance, which declare unfeigned<br/>

Union of mind, or in us both one soul;<br/>

Harmony to behold in wedded pair<br/>

More grateful than harmonious sound to the ear.<br/>

Yet these subject not; I to thee disclose<br/>

What inward thence I feel, not therefore foiled,<br/>

Who meet with various objects, from the sense<br/>

Variously representing; yet, still free,<br/>

Approve the best, and follow what I approve.<br/>

To love, thou blamest me not; for Love, thou sayest,<br/>

Leads up to Heaven, is both the way and guide;<br/>

Bear with me then, if lawful what I ask:<br/>

Love not the heavenly Spirits, and how their love<br/>

Express they? by looks only? or do they mix<br/>

Irradiance, virtual or immediate touch?<br/>

To whom the Angel, with a smile that glowed<br/>

Celestial rosy red, Love's proper hue,<br/>

Answered.  Let it suffice thee that thou knowest<br/>

Us happy, and without love no happiness.<br/>

Whatever pure thou in the body enjoyest,<br/>

(And pure thou wert created) we enjoy<br/>

In eminence; and obstacle find none<br/>

Of membrane, joint, or limb, exclusive bars;<br/>

Easier than air with air, if Spirits embrace,<br/>

Total they mix, union of pure with pure<br/>

Desiring, nor restrained conveyance need,<br/>

As flesh to mix with flesh, or soul with soul.<br/>

But I can now no more; the parting sun<br/>

Beyond the Earth's green Cape and verdant Isles<br/>

Hesperian sets, my signal to depart.<br/>

Be strong, live happy, and love!  But, first of all,<br/>

Him, whom to love is to obey, and keep<br/>

His great command; take heed lest passion sway<br/>

Thy judgement to do aught, which else free will<br/>

Would not admit: thine, and of all thy sons,<br/>

The weal or woe in thee is placed; beware!<br/>

I in thy persevering shall rejoice,<br/>

And all the Blest:  Stand fast; to stand or fall<br/>

Free in thine own arbitrement it lies.<br/>

Perfect within, no outward aid require;<br/>

And all temptation to transgress repel.<br/>

So saying, he arose; whom Adam thus<br/>

Followed with benediction.  Since to part,<br/>

Go, heavenly guest, ethereal Messenger,<br/>

Sent from whose sovran goodness I adore!<br/>

Gentle to me and affable hath been<br/>

Thy condescension, and shall be honoured ever<br/>

With grateful memory:  Thou to mankind<br/>

Be good and friendly still, and oft return!<br/>

So parted they; the Angel up to Heaven<br/>

From the thick shade, and Adam to his bower.<br/>

From pole to pole, traversing each colure;<br/>

On the eighth returned; and, on the coast averse<br/>

From entrance or Cherubick watch, by stealth<br/>

Found unsuspected way.  There was a place,<br/>

Now not, though sin, not time, first wrought the change,<br/>

Where Tigris, at the foot of Paradise,<br/>

Into a gulf shot under ground, till part<br/>

Rose up a fountain by the tree of life:<br/>

In with the river sunk, and with it rose<br/>

Satan, involved in rising mist; then sought<br/>

Where to lie hid; sea he had searched, and land,<br/>

From Eden over Pontus and the pool<br/>

Maeotis, up beyond the river Ob;<br/>

Downward as far antarctick; and in length,<br/>

West from Orontes to the ocean barred<br/>

At Darien; thence to the land where flows<br/>

Ganges and Indus: Thus the orb he roamed<br/>

With narrow search; and with inspection deep<br/>

Considered every creature, which of all<br/>

Most opportune might serve his wiles; and found<br/>

The Serpent subtlest beast of all the field.<br/>

Him after long debate, irresolute<br/>

Of thoughts revolved, his final sentence chose<br/>

Fit vessel, fittest imp of fraud, in whom<br/>

To enter, and his dark suggestions hide<br/>

From sharpest sight: for, in the wily snake<br/>

Whatever sleights, none would suspicious mark,<br/>

As from his wit and native subtlety<br/>

Proceeding; which, in other beasts observed,<br/>

Doubt might beget of diabolick power<br/>

Active within, beyond the sense of brute.<br/>

Thus he resolved, but first from inward grief<br/>

His bursting passion into plaints thus poured.<br/>

More justly, seat worthier of Gods, as built<br/>

With second thoughts, reforming what was old!<br/>

O Earth, how like to Heaven, if not preferred<br/>

For what God, after better, worse would build?<br/>

Terrestrial Heaven, danced round by other Heavens<br/>

That shine, yet bear their bright officious lamps,<br/>

Light above light, for thee alone, as seems,<br/>

In thee concentring all their precious beams<br/>

Of sacred influence!  As God in Heaven<br/>

Is center, yet extends to all; so thou,<br/>

Centring, receivest from all those orbs: in thee,<br/>

Not in themselves, all their known virtue appears<br/>

Productive in herb, plant, and nobler birth<br/>

Of creatures animate with gradual life<br/>

Of growth, sense, reason, all summed up in Man.<br/>

With what delight could I have walked thee round,<br/>

If I could joy in aught, sweet interchange<br/>

Of hill, and valley, rivers, woods, and plains,<br/>

Now land, now sea and shores with forest crowned,<br/>

Rocks, dens, and caves!  But I in none of these<br/>

Find place or refuge; and the more I see<br/>

Pleasures about me, so much more I feel<br/>

Torment within me, as from the hateful siege<br/>

Of contraries: all good to me becomes<br/>

Bane, and in Heaven much worse would be my state.<br/>

But neither here seek I, no nor in Heaven<br/>

To dwell, unless by mastering Heaven's Supreme;<br/>

Nor hope to be myself less miserable<br/>

By what I seek, but others to make such<br/>

As I, though thereby worse to me redound:<br/>

For only in destroying I find ease<br/>

To my relentless thoughts; and, him destroyed,<br/>

Or won to what may work his utter loss,<br/>

For whom all this was made, all this will soon<br/>

Follow, as to him linked in weal or woe;<br/>

In woe then; that destruction wide may range:<br/>

To me shall be the glory sole among<br/>

The infernal Powers, in one day to have marred<br/>

What he, Almighty styled, six nights and days<br/>

Continued making; and who knows how long<br/>

Before had been contriving? though perhaps<br/>

Not longer than since I, in one night, freed<br/>

From servitude inglorious well nigh half<br/>

The angelick name, and thinner left the throng<br/>

Of his adorers: He, to be avenged,<br/>

And to repair his numbers thus impaired,<br/>

Whether such virtue spent of old now failed<br/>

More Angels to create, if they at least<br/>

Are his created, or, to spite us more,<br/>

Determined to advance into our room<br/>

A creature formed of earth, and him endow,<br/>

Exalted from so base original,<br/>

With heavenly spoils, our spoils: What he decreed,<br/>

He effected; Man he made, and for him built<br/>

Magnificent this world, and earth his seat,<br/>

Him lord pronounced; and, O indignity!<br/>

Subjected to his service angel-wings,<br/>

And flaming ministers to watch and tend<br/>

Their earthly charge: Of these the vigilance<br/>

I dread; and, to elude, thus wrapt in mist<br/>

Of midnight vapour glide obscure, and pry<br/>

In every bush and brake, where hap may find<br/>

The serpent sleeping; in whose mazy folds<br/>

To hide me, and the dark intent I bring.<br/>

O foul descent! that I, who erst contended<br/>

With Gods to sit the highest, am now constrained<br/>

Into a beast; and, mixed with bestial slime,<br/>

This essence to incarnate and imbrute,<br/>

That to the highth of Deity aspired!<br/>

But what will not ambition and revenge<br/>

Descend to?  Who aspires, must down as low<br/>

As high he soared; obnoxious, first or last,<br/>

To basest things.  Revenge, at first though sweet,<br/>

Bitter ere long, back on itself recoils:<br/>

Let it; I reck not, so it light well aimed,<br/>

Since higher I fall short, on him who next<br/>

Provokes my envy, this new favourite<br/>

Of Heaven, this man of clay, son of despite,<br/>

Whom, us the more to spite, his Maker raised<br/>

From dust: Spite then with spite is best repaid.<br/>

So saying, through each thicket dank or dry,<br/>

Like a black mist low-creeping, he held on<br/>

His midnight-search, where soonest he might find<br/>

The serpent; him fast-sleeping soon he found<br/>

In labyrinth of many a round self-rolled,<br/>

His head the midst, well stored with subtile wiles:<br/>

Not yet in horrid shade or dismal den,<br/>

Nor nocent yet; but, on the grassy herb,<br/>

Fearless unfeared he slept: in at his mouth<br/>

The Devil entered; and his brutal sense,<br/>

In heart or head, possessing, soon inspired<br/>

With act intelligential; but his sleep<br/>

Disturbed not, waiting close the approach of morn.<br/>

Now, when as sacred light began to dawn<br/>

In Eden on the humid flowers, that breathed<br/>

Their morning incense, when all things, that breathe,<br/>

From the Earth's great altar send up silent praise<br/>

To the Creator, and his nostrils fill<br/>

With grateful smell, forth came the human pair,<br/>

And joined their vocal worship to the quire<br/>

Of creatures wanting voice; that done, partake<br/>

The season prime for sweetest scents and airs:<br/>

Then commune, how that day they best may ply<br/>

Their growing work: for much their work out-grew<br/>

The hands' dispatch of two gardening so wide,<br/>

And Eve first to her husband thus began.<br/>

Adam, well may we labour still to dress<br/>

This garden, still to tend plant, herb, and flower,<br/>

Our pleasant task enjoined; but, till more hands<br/>

Aid us, the work under our labour grows,<br/>

Luxurious by restraint; what we by day<br/>

Lop overgrown, or prune, or prop, or bind,<br/>

One night or two with wanton growth derides<br/>

Tending to wild.  Thou therefore now advise,<br/>

Or bear what to my mind first thoughts present:<br/>

Let us divide our labours; thou, where choice<br/>

Leads thee, or where most needs, whether to wind<br/>

The woodbine round this arbour, or direct<br/>

The clasping ivy where to climb; while I,<br/>

In yonder spring of roses intermixed<br/>

With myrtle, find what to redress till noon:<br/>

For, while so near each other thus all day<br/>

Our task we choose, what wonder if so near<br/>

Looks intervene and smiles, or object new<br/>

Casual discourse draw on; which intermits<br/>

Our day's work, brought to little, though begun<br/>

Early, and the hour of supper comes unearned?<br/>

To whom mild answer Adam thus returned.<br/>

Sole Eve, associate sole, to me beyond<br/>

Compare above all living creatures dear!<br/>

Well hast thou motioned, well thy thoughts employed,<br/>

How we might best fulfil the work which here<br/>

God hath assigned us; nor of me shalt pass<br/>

Unpraised: for nothing lovelier can be found<br/>

In woman, than to study houshold good,<br/>

And good works in her husband to promote.<br/>

Yet not so strictly hath our Lord imposed<br/>

Labour, as to debar us when we need<br/>

Refreshment, whether food, or talk between,<br/>

Food of the mind, or this sweet intercourse<br/>

Of looks and smiles; for smiles from reason flow,<br/>

To brute denied, and are of love the food;<br/>

Love, not the lowest end of human life.<br/>

For not to irksome toil, but to delight,<br/>

He made us, and delight to reason joined.<br/>

These paths and bowers doubt not but our joint hands<br/>

Will keep from wilderness with ease, as wide<br/>

As we need walk, till younger hands ere long<br/>

Assist us; But, if much converse perhaps<br/>

Thee satiate, to short absence I could yield:<br/>

For solitude sometimes is best society,<br/>

And short retirement urges sweet return.<br/>

But other doubt possesses me, lest harm<br/>

Befall thee severed from me; for thou knowest<br/>

What hath been warned us, what malicious foe<br/>

Envying our happiness, and of his own<br/>

Despairing, seeks to work us woe and shame<br/>

By sly assault; and somewhere nigh at hand<br/>

Watches, no doubt, with greedy hope to find<br/>

His wish and best advantage, us asunder;<br/>

Hopeless to circumvent us joined, where each<br/>

To other speedy aid might lend at need:<br/>

Whether his first design be to withdraw<br/>

Our fealty from God, or to disturb<br/>

Conjugal love, than which perhaps no bliss<br/>

Enjoyed by us excites his envy more;<br/>

Or this, or worse, leave not the faithful side<br/>

That gave thee being, still shades thee, and protects.<br/>

The wife, where danger or dishonour lurks,<br/>

Safest and seemliest by her husband stays,<br/>

Who guards her, or with her the worst endures.<br/>

To whom the virgin majesty of Eve,<br/>

As one who loves, and some unkindness meets,<br/>

With sweet austere composure thus replied.<br/>

Offspring of Heaven and Earth, and all Earth's Lord!<br/>

That such an enemy we have, who seeks<br/>

Our ruin, both by thee informed I learn,<br/>

And from the parting Angel over-heard,<br/>

As in a shady nook I stood behind,<br/>

Just then returned at shut of evening flowers.<br/>

But, that thou shouldst my firmness therefore doubt<br/>

To God or thee, because we have a foe<br/>

May tempt it, I expected not to hear.<br/>

His violence thou fearest not, being such<br/>

As we, not capable of death or pain,<br/>

Can either not receive, or can repel.<br/>

His fraud is then thy fear; which plain infers<br/>

Thy equal fear, that my firm faith and love<br/>

Can by his fraud be shaken or seduced;<br/>

Thoughts, which how found they harbour in thy breast,<br/>

Adam, mis-thought of her to thee so dear?<br/>

To whom with healing words Adam replied.<br/>

Daughter of God and Man, immortal Eve!<br/>

For such thou art; from sin and blame entire:<br/>

Not diffident of thee do I dissuade<br/>

Thy absence from my sight, but to avoid<br/>

The attempt itself, intended by our foe.<br/>

For he who tempts, though in vain, at least asperses<br/>

The tempted with dishonour foul; supposed<br/>

Not incorruptible of faith, not proof<br/>

Against temptation: Thou thyself with scorn<br/>

And anger wouldst resent the offered wrong,<br/>

Though ineffectual found: misdeem not then,<br/>

If such affront I labour to avert<br/>

From thee alone, which on us both at once<br/>

The enemy, though bold, will hardly dare;<br/>

Or daring, first on me the assault shall light.<br/>

Nor thou his malice and false guile contemn;<br/>

Subtle he needs must be, who could seduce<br/>

Angels; nor think superfluous other's aid.<br/>

I, from the influence of thy looks, receive<br/>

Access in every virtue; in thy sight<br/>

More wise, more watchful, stronger, if need were<br/>

Of outward strength; while shame, thou looking on,<br/>

Shame to be overcome or over-reached,<br/>

Would utmost vigour raise, and raised unite.<br/>

Why shouldst not thou like sense within thee feel<br/>

When I am present, and thy trial choose<br/>

With me, best witness of thy virtue tried?<br/>

So spake domestick Adam in his care<br/>

And matrimonial love; but Eve, who thought<br/>

Less attributed to her faith sincere,<br/>

Thus her reply with accent sweet renewed.<br/>

If this be our condition, thus to dwell<br/>

In narrow circuit straitened by a foe,<br/>

Subtle or violent, we not endued<br/>

Single with like defence, wherever met;<br/>

How are we happy, still in fear of harm?<br/>

But harm precedes not sin: only our foe,<br/>

Tempting, affronts us with his foul esteem<br/>

Of our integrity: his foul esteem<br/>

Sticks no dishonour on our front, but turns<br/>

Foul on himself; then wherefore shunned or feared<br/>

By us? who rather double honour gain<br/>

From his surmise proved false; find peace within,<br/>

Favour from Heaven, our witness, from the event.<br/>

And what is faith, love, virtue, unassayed<br/>

Alone, without exteriour help sustained?<br/>

Let us not then suspect our happy state<br/>

Left so imperfect by the Maker wise,<br/>

As not secure to single or combined.<br/>

Frail is our happiness, if this be so,<br/>

And Eden were no Eden, thus exposed.<br/>

To whom thus Adam fervently replied.<br/>

O Woman, best are all things as the will<br/>

Of God ordained them: His creating hand<br/>

Nothing imperfect or deficient left<br/>

Of all that he created, much less Man,<br/>

Or aught that might his happy state secure,<br/>

Secure from outward force; within himself<br/>

The danger lies, yet lies within his power:<br/>

Against his will he can receive no harm.<br/>

But God left free the will; for what obeys<br/>

Reason, is free; and Reason he made right,<br/>

But bid her well be ware, and still erect;<br/>

Lest, by some fair-appearing good surprised,<br/>

She dictate false; and mis-inform the will<br/>

To do what God expressly hath forbid.<br/>

Not then mistrust, but tender love, enjoins,<br/>

That I should mind thee oft; and mind thou me.<br/>

Firm we subsist, yet possible to swerve;<br/>

Since Reason not impossibly may meet<br/>

Some specious object by the foe suborned,<br/>

And fall into deception unaware,<br/>

Not keeping strictest watch, as she was warned.<br/>

Seek not temptation then, which to avoid<br/>

Were better, and most likely if from me<br/>

Thou sever not: Trial will come unsought.<br/>

Wouldst thou approve thy constancy, approve<br/>

First thy obedience; the other who can know,<br/>

Not seeing thee attempted, who attest?<br/>

But, if thou think, trial unsought may find<br/>

Us both securer than thus warned thou seemest,<br/>

Go; for thy stay, not free, absents thee more;<br/>

Go in thy native innocence, rely<br/>

On what thou hast of virtue; summon all!<br/>

For God towards thee hath done his part, do thine.<br/>

So spake the patriarch of mankind; but Eve<br/>

Persisted; yet submiss, though last, replied.<br/>

With thy permission then, and thus forewarned<br/>

Chiefly by what thy own last reasoning words<br/>

Touched only; that our trial, when least sought,<br/>

May find us both perhaps far less prepared,<br/>

The willinger I go, nor much expect<br/>

A foe so proud will first the weaker seek;<br/>

So bent, the more shall shame him his repulse.<br/>

Thus saying, from her husband's hand her hand<br/>

Soft she withdrew; and, like a Wood-Nymph light,<br/>

Oread or Dryad, or of Delia's train,<br/>

Betook her to the groves; but Delia's self<br/>

In gait surpassed, and Goddess-like deport,<br/>

Though not as she with bow and quiver armed,<br/>

But with such gardening tools as Art yet rude,<br/>

Guiltless of fire, had formed, or Angels brought.<br/>

To Pales, or Pomona, thus adorned,<br/>

Likest she seemed, Pomona when she fled<br/>

Vertumnus, or to Ceres in her prime,<br/>

Yet virgin of Proserpina from Jove.<br/>

Her long with ardent look his eye pursued<br/>

Delighted, but desiring more her stay.<br/>

Oft he to her his charge of quick return<br/>

Repeated; she to him as oft engaged<br/>

To be returned by noon amid the bower,<br/>

And all things in best order to invite<br/>

Noontide repast, or afternoon's repose.<br/>

O much deceived, much failing, hapless Eve,<br/>

Of thy presumed return! event perverse!<br/>

Thou never from that hour in Paradise<br/>

Foundst either sweet repast, or sound repose;<br/>

Such ambush, hid among sweet flowers and shades,<br/>

Waited with hellish rancour imminent<br/>

To intercept thy way, or send thee back<br/>

Despoiled of innocence, of faith, of bliss!<br/>

For now, and since first break of dawn, the Fiend,<br/>

Mere serpent in appearance, forth was come;<br/>

And on his quest, where likeliest he might find<br/>

The only two of mankind, but in them<br/>

The whole included race, his purposed prey.<br/>

In bower and field he sought, where any tuft<br/>

Of grove or garden-plot more pleasant lay,<br/>

Their tendance, or plantation for delight;<br/>

By fountain or by shady rivulet<br/>

He sought them both, but wished his hap might find<br/>

Eve separate; he wished, but not with hope<br/>

Of what so seldom chanced; when to his wish,<br/>

Beyond his hope, Eve separate he spies,<br/>

Veiled in a cloud of fragrance, where she stood,<br/>

Half spied, so thick the roses blushing round<br/>

About her glowed, oft stooping to support<br/>

Each flower of slender stalk, whose head, though gay<br/>

Carnation, purple, azure, or specked with gold,<br/>

Hung drooping unsustained; them she upstays<br/>

Gently with myrtle band, mindless the while<br/>

Herself, though fairest unsupported flower,<br/>

From her best prop so far, and storm so nigh.<br/>

Nearer he drew, and many a walk traversed<br/>

Of stateliest covert, cedar, pine, or palm;<br/>

Then voluble and bold, now hid, now seen,<br/>

Among thick-woven arborets, and flowers<br/>

Imbordered on each bank, the hand of Eve:<br/>

Spot more delicious than those gardens feigned<br/>

Or of revived Adonis, or renowned<br/>

Alcinous, host of old Laertes' son;<br/>

Or that, not mystick, where the sapient king<br/>

Held dalliance with his fair Egyptian spouse.<br/>

Much he the place admired, the person more.<br/>

As one who long in populous city pent,<br/>

Where houses thick and sewers annoy the air,<br/>

Forth issuing on a summer's morn, to breathe<br/>

Among the pleasant villages and farms<br/>

Adjoined, from each thing met conceives delight;<br/>

The smell of grain, or tedded grass, or kine,<br/>

Or dairy, each rural sight, each rural sound;<br/>

If chance, with nymph-like step, fair virgin pass,<br/>

What pleasing seemed, for her now pleases more;<br/>

She most, and in her look sums all delight:<br/>

Such pleasure took the Serpent to behold<br/>

This flowery plat, the sweet recess of Eve<br/>

Thus early, thus alone: Her heavenly form<br/>

Angelick, but more soft, and feminine,<br/>

Her graceful innocence, her every air<br/>

Of gesture, or least action, overawed<br/>

His malice, and with rapine sweet bereaved<br/>

His fierceness of the fierce intent it brought:<br/>

That space the Evil-one abstracted stood<br/>

From his own evil, and for the time remained<br/>

Stupidly good; of enmity disarmed,<br/>

Of guile, of hate, of envy, of revenge:<br/>

But the hot Hell that always in him burns,<br/>

Though in mid Heaven, soon ended his delight,<br/>

And tortures him now more, the more he sees<br/>

Of pleasure, not for him ordained: then soon<br/>

Fierce hate he recollects, and all his thoughts<br/>

Of mischief, gratulating, thus excites.<br/>

Thoughts, whither have ye led me! with what sweet<br/>

Compulsion thus transported, to forget<br/>

What hither brought us! hate, not love; nor hope<br/>

Of Paradise for Hell, hope here to taste<br/>

Of pleasure; but all pleasure to destroy,<br/>

Save what is in destroying; other joy<br/>

To me is lost.  Then, let me not let pass<br/>

Occasion which now smiles; behold alone<br/>

The woman, opportune to all attempts,<br/>

Her husband, for I view far round, not nigh,<br/>

Whose higher intellectual more I shun,<br/>

And strength, of courage haughty, and of limb<br/>

Heroick built, though of terrestrial mould;<br/>

Foe not informidable! exempt from wound,<br/>

I not; so much hath Hell debased, and pain<br/>

Enfeebled me, to what I was in Heaven.<br/>

She fair, divinely fair, fit love for Gods!<br/>

Not terrible, though terrour be in love<br/>

And beauty, not approached by stronger hate,<br/>

Hate stronger, under show of love well feigned;<br/>

The way which to her ruin now I tend.<br/>

So spake the enemy of mankind, enclosed<br/>

In serpent, inmate bad! and toward Eve<br/>

Addressed his way: not with indented wave,<br/>

Prone on the ground, as since; but on his rear,<br/>

Circular base of rising folds, that towered<br/>

Fold above fold, a surging maze! his head<br/>

Crested aloft, and carbuncle his eyes;<br/>

With burnished neck of verdant gold, erect<br/>

Amidst his circling spires, that on the grass<br/>

Floated redundant: pleasing was his shape<br/>

And lovely; never since of serpent-kind<br/>

Lovelier, not those that in Illyria changed,<br/>

Hermione and Cadmus, or the god<br/>

In Epidaurus; nor to which transformed<br/>

Ammonian Jove, or Capitoline, was seen;<br/>

He with Olympias; this with her who bore<br/>

Scipio, the highth of Rome.  With tract oblique<br/>

At first, as one who sought access, but feared<br/>

To interrupt, side-long he works his way.<br/>

As when a ship, by skilful steersmen wrought<br/>

Nigh river's mouth or foreland, where the wind<br/>

Veers oft, as oft so steers, and shifts her sail:<br/>

So varied he, and of his tortuous train<br/>

Curled many a wanton wreath in sight of Eve,<br/>

To lure her eye; she, busied, heard the sound<br/>

Of rusling leaves, but minded not, as used<br/>

To such disport before her through the field,<br/>

From every beast; more duteous at her call,<br/>

Than at Circean call the herd disguised.<br/>

He, bolder now, uncalled before her stood,<br/>

But as in gaze admiring: oft he bowed<br/>

His turret crest, and sleek enamelled neck,<br/>

Fawning; and licked the ground whereon she trod.<br/>

His gentle dumb expression turned at length<br/>

The eye of Eve to mark his play; he, glad<br/>

Of her attention gained, with serpent-tongue<br/>

Organick, or impulse of vocal air,<br/>

His fraudulent temptation thus began.<br/>

Wonder not, sovran Mistress, if perhaps<br/>

Thou canst, who art sole wonder! much less arm<br/>

Thy looks, the Heaven of mildness, with disdain,<br/>

Displeased that I approach thee thus, and gaze<br/>

Insatiate; I thus single; nor have feared<br/>

Thy awful brow, more awful thus retired.<br/>

Fairest resemblance of thy Maker fair,<br/>

Thee all things living gaze on, all things thine<br/>

By gift, and thy celestial beauty adore<br/>

With ravishment beheld! there best beheld,<br/>

Where universally admired; but here<br/>

In this enclosure wild, these beasts among,<br/>

Beholders rude, and shallow to discern<br/>

Half what in thee is fair, one man except,<br/>

Who sees thee? and what is one? who should be seen<br/>

A Goddess among Gods, adored and served<br/>

By Angels numberless, thy daily train.<br/>

So glozed the Tempter, and his proem tuned:<br/>

Into the heart of Eve his words made way,<br/>

Though at the voice much marvelling; at length,<br/>

Not unamazed, she thus in answer spake.<br/>

What may this mean? language of man pronounced<br/>

By tongue of brute, and human sense expressed?<br/>

The first, at least, of these I thought denied<br/>

To beasts; whom God, on their creation-day,<br/>

Created mute to all articulate sound:<br/>

The latter I demur; for in their looks<br/>

Much reason, and in their actions, oft appears.<br/>

Thee, Serpent, subtlest beast of all the field<br/>

I knew, but not with human voice endued;<br/>

Redouble then this miracle, and say,<br/>

How camest thou speakable of mute, and how<br/>

To me so friendly grown above the rest<br/>

Of brutal kind, that daily are in sight?<br/>

Say, for such wonder claims attention due.<br/>

To whom the guileful Tempter thus replied.<br/>

Empress of this fair world, resplendent Eve!<br/>

Easy to me it is to tell thee all<br/>

What thou commandest; and right thou shouldst be obeyed:<br/>

I was at first as other beasts that graze<br/>

The trodden herb, of abject thoughts and low,<br/>

As was my food; nor aught but food discerned<br/>

Or sex, and apprehended nothing high:<br/>

Till, on a day roving the field, I chanced<br/>

A goodly tree far distant to behold<br/>

Loaden with fruit of fairest colours mixed,<br/>

Ruddy and gold: I nearer drew to gaze;<br/>

When from the boughs a savoury odour blown,<br/>

Grateful to appetite, more pleased my sense<br/>

Than smell of sweetest fennel, or the teats<br/>

Of ewe or goat dropping with milk at even,<br/>

Unsucked of lamb or kid, that tend their play.<br/>

To satisfy the sharp desire I had<br/>

Of tasting those fair apples, I resolved<br/>

Not to defer; hunger and thirst at once,<br/>

Powerful persuaders, quickened at the scent<br/>

Of that alluring fruit, urged me so keen.<br/>

About the mossy trunk I wound me soon;<br/>

For, high from ground, the branches would require<br/>

Thy utmost reach or Adam's: Round the tree<br/>

All other beasts that saw, with like desire<br/>

Longing and envying stood, but could not reach.<br/>

Amid the tree now got, where plenty hung<br/>

Tempting so nigh, to pluck and eat my fill<br/>

I spared not; for, such pleasure till that hour,<br/>

At feed or fountain, never had I found.<br/>

Sated at length, ere long I might perceive<br/>

Strange alteration in me, to degree<br/>

Of reason in my inward powers; and speech<br/>

Wanted not long; though to this shape retained.<br/>

Thenceforth to speculations high or deep<br/>

I turned my thoughts, and with capacious mind<br/>

Considered all things visible in Heaven,<br/>

Or Earth, or Middle; all things fair and good:<br/>

But all that fair and good in thy divine<br/>

Semblance, and in thy beauty's heavenly ray,<br/>

United I beheld; no fair to thine<br/>

Equivalent or second! which compelled<br/>

Me thus, though importune perhaps, to come<br/>

And gaze, and worship thee of right declared<br/>

Sovran of creatures, universal Dame!<br/>

So talked the spirited sly Snake; and Eve,<br/>

Yet more amazed, unwary thus replied.<br/>

Serpent, thy overpraising leaves in doubt<br/>

The virtue of that fruit, in thee first proved:<br/>

But say, where grows the tree? from hence how far?<br/>

For many are the trees of God that grow<br/>

In Paradise, and various, yet unknown<br/>

To us; in such abundance lies our choice,<br/>

As leaves a greater store of fruit untouched,<br/>

Still hanging incorruptible, till men<br/>

Grow up to their provision, and more hands<br/>

Help to disburden Nature of her birth.<br/>

To whom the wily Adder, blithe and glad.<br/>

Empress, the way is ready, and not long;<br/>

Beyond a row of myrtles, on a flat,<br/>

Fast by a fountain, one small thicket past<br/>

Of blowing myrrh and balm: if thou accept<br/>

My conduct, I can bring thee thither soon<br/>

Lead then, said Eve.  He, leading, swiftly rolled<br/>

In tangles, and made intricate seem straight,<br/>

To mischief swift.  Hope elevates, and joy<br/>

Brightens his crest; as when a wandering fire,<br/>

Compact of unctuous vapour, which the night<br/>

Condenses, and the cold environs round,<br/>

Kindled through agitation to a flame,<br/>

Which oft, they say, some evil Spirit attends,<br/>

Hovering and blazing with delusive light,<br/>

Misleads the amazed night-wanderer from his way<br/>

To bogs and mires, and oft through pond or pool;<br/>

There swallowed up and lost, from succour far.<br/>

So glistered the dire Snake, and into fraud<br/>

Led Eve, our credulous mother, to the tree<br/>

Of prohibition, root of all our woe;<br/>

Which when she saw, thus to her guide she spake.<br/>

Serpent, we might have spared our coming hither,<br/>

Fruitless to me, though fruit be here to excess,<br/>

The credit of whose virtue rest with thee;<br/>

Wonderous indeed, if cause of such effects.<br/>

But of this tree we may not taste nor touch;<br/>

God so commanded, and left that command<br/>

Sole daughter of his voice; the rest, we live<br/>

Law to ourselves; our reason is our law.<br/>

To whom the Tempter guilefully replied.<br/>

Indeed! hath God then said that of the fruit<br/>

Of all these garden-trees ye shall not eat,<br/>

Yet Lords declared of all in earth or air?<br/>

To whom thus Eve, yet sinless.  Of the fruit<br/>

Of each tree in the garden we may eat;<br/>

But of the fruit of this fair tree amidst<br/>

The garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat<br/>

Thereof, nor shall ye touch it, lest ye die.<br/>

She scarce had said, though brief, when now more bold<br/>

The Tempter, but with show of zeal and love<br/>

To Man, and indignation at his wrong,<br/>

New part puts on; and, as to passion moved,<br/>

Fluctuates disturbed, yet comely and in act<br/>

Raised, as of some great matter to begin.<br/>

As when of old some orator renowned,<br/>

In Athens or free Rome, where eloquence<br/>

Flourished, since mute! to some great cause addressed,<br/>

Stood in himself collected; while each part,<br/>

Motion, each act, won audience ere the tongue;<br/>

Sometimes in highth began, as no delay<br/>

Of preface brooking, through his zeal of right:<br/>

So standing, moving, or to highth up grown,<br/>

The Tempter, all impassioned, thus began.<br/>

O sacred, wise, and wisdom-giving Plant,<br/>

Mother of science! now I feel thy power<br/>

Within me clear; not only to discern<br/>

Things in their causes, but to trace the ways<br/>

Of highest agents, deemed however wise.<br/>

Queen of this universe! do not believe<br/>

Those rigid threats of death: ye shall not die:<br/>

How should you? by the fruit? it gives you life<br/>

To knowledge; by the threatener? look on me,<br/>

Me, who have touched and tasted; yet both live,<br/>

And life more perfect have attained than Fate<br/>

Meant me, by venturing higher than my lot.<br/>

Shall that be shut to Man, which to the Beast<br/>

Is open? or will God incense his ire<br/>

For such a petty trespass? and not praise<br/>

Rather your dauntless virtue, whom the pain<br/>

Of death denounced, whatever thing death be,<br/>

Deterred not from achieving what might lead<br/>

To happier life, knowledge of good and evil;<br/>

Of good, how just? of evil, if what is evil<br/>

Be real, why not known, since easier shunned?<br/>

God therefore cannot hurt ye, and be just;<br/>

Not just, not God; not feared then, nor obeyed:<br/>

Your fear itself of death removes the fear.<br/>

Why then was this forbid?  Why, but to awe;<br/>

Why, but to keep ye low and ignorant,<br/>

His worshippers?  He knows that in the day<br/>

Ye eat thereof, your eyes that seem so clear,<br/>

Yet are but dim, shall perfectly be then<br/>

Opened and cleared, and ye shall be as Gods,<br/>

Knowing both good and evil, as they know.<br/>

That ye shall be as Gods, since I as Man,<br/>

Internal Man, is but proportion meet;<br/>

I, of brute, human; ye, of human, Gods.<br/>

So ye shall die perhaps, by putting off<br/>

Human, to put on Gods; death to be wished,<br/>

Though threatened, which no worse than this can bring.<br/>

And what are Gods, that Man may not become<br/>

As they, participating God-like food?<br/>

The Gods are first, and that advantage use<br/>

On our belief, that all from them proceeds:<br/>

I question it; for this fair earth I see,<br/>

Warmed by the sun, producing every kind;<br/>

Them, nothing: if they all things, who enclosed<br/>

Knowledge of good and evil in this tree,<br/>

That whoso eats thereof, forthwith attains<br/>

Wisdom without their leave? and wherein lies<br/>

The offence, that Man should thus attain to know?<br/>

What can your knowledge hurt him, or this tree<br/>

Impart against his will, if all be his?<br/>

Or is it envy? and can envy dwell<br/>

In heavenly breasts?  These, these, and many more<br/>

Causes import your need of this fair fruit.<br/>

Goddess humane, reach then, and freely taste!<br/>

He ended; and his words, replete with guile,<br/>

Into her heart too easy entrance won:<br/>

Fixed on the fruit she gazed, which to behold<br/>

Might tempt alone; and in her ears the sound<br/>

Yet rung of his persuasive words, impregned<br/>

With reason, to her seeming, and with truth:<br/>

Mean while the hour of noon drew on, and waked<br/>

An eager appetite, raised by the smell<br/>

So savoury of that fruit, which with desire,<br/>

Inclinable now grown to touch or taste,<br/>

Solicited her longing eye; yet first<br/>

Pausing a while, thus to herself she mused.<br/>

Great are thy virtues, doubtless, best of fruits,<br/>

Though kept from man, and worthy to be admired;<br/>

Whose taste, too long forborn, at first assay<br/>

Gave elocution to the mute, and taught<br/>

The tongue not made for speech to speak thy praise:<br/>

Thy praise he also, who forbids thy use,<br/>

Conceals not from us, naming thee the tree<br/>

Of knowledge, knowledge both of good and evil;<br/>

Forbids us then to taste! but his forbidding<br/>

Commends thee more, while it infers the good<br/>

By thee communicated, and our want:<br/>

For good unknown sure is not had; or, had<br/>

And yet unknown, is as not had at all.<br/>

In plain then, what forbids he but to know,<br/>

Forbids us good, forbids us to be wise?<br/>

Such prohibitions bind not.  But, if death<br/>

Bind us with after-bands, what profits then<br/>

Our inward freedom?  In the day we eat<br/>

Of this fair fruit, our doom is, we shall die!<br/>

How dies the Serpent? he hath eaten and lives,<br/>

And knows, and speaks, and reasons, and discerns,<br/>

Irrational till then.  For us alone<br/>

Was death invented? or to us denied<br/>

This intellectual food, for beasts reserved?<br/>

For beasts it seems: yet that one beast which first<br/>

Hath tasted envies not, but brings with joy<br/>

The good befallen him, author unsuspect,<br/>

Friendly to man, far from deceit or guile.<br/>

What fear I then? rather, what know to fear<br/>

Under this ignorance of good and evil,<br/>

Of God or death, of law or penalty?<br/>

Here grows the cure of all, this fruit divine,<br/>

Fair to the eye, inviting to the taste,<br/>

Of virtue to make wise:  What hinders then<br/>

To reach, and feed at once both body and mind?<br/>

So saying, her rash hand in evil hour<br/>

Forth reaching to the fruit, she plucked, she eat!<br/>

Earth felt the wound; and Nature from her seat,<br/>

Sighing through all her works, gave signs of woe,<br/>

That all was lost.  Back to the thicket slunk<br/>

The guilty Serpent; and well might; for Eve,<br/>

Intent now wholly on her taste, nought else<br/>

Regarded; such delight till then, as seemed,<br/>

In fruit she never tasted, whether true<br/>

Or fancied so, through expectation high<br/>

Of knowledge; not was Godhead from her thought.<br/>

Greedily she ingorged without restraint,<br/>

And knew not eating death:  Satiate at length,<br/>

And hightened as with wine, jocund and boon,<br/>

Thus to herself she pleasingly began.<br/>

O sovran, virtuous, precious of all trees<br/>

In Paradise! of operation blest<br/>

To sapience, hitherto obscured, infamed.<br/>

And thy fair fruit let hang, as to no end<br/>

Created; but henceforth my early care,<br/>

Not without song, each morning, and due praise,<br/>

Shall tend thee, and the fertile burden ease<br/>

Of thy full branches offered free to all;<br/>

Till, dieted by thee, I grow mature<br/>

In knowledge, as the Gods, who all things know;<br/>

Though others envy what they cannot give:<br/>

For, had the gift been theirs, it had not here<br/>

Thus grown.  Experience, next, to thee I owe,<br/>

Best guide; not following thee, I had remained<br/>

In ignorance; thou openest wisdom's way,<br/>

And givest access, though secret she retire.<br/>

And I perhaps am secret: Heaven is high,<br/>

High, and remote to see from thence distinct<br/>

Each thing on Earth; and other care perhaps<br/>

May have diverted from continual watch<br/>

Our great Forbidder, safe with all his spies<br/>

About him.  But to Adam in what sort<br/>

Shall I appear? shall I to him make known<br/>

As yet my change, and give him to partake<br/>

Full happiness with me, or rather not,<br/>

But keeps the odds of knowledge in my power<br/>

Without copartner? so to add what wants<br/>

In female sex, the more to draw his love,<br/>

And render me more equal; and perhaps,<br/>

A thing not undesirable, sometime<br/>

Superiour; for, inferiour, who is free<br/>

This may be well:  But what if God have seen,<br/>

And death ensue? then I shall be no more!<br/>

And Adam, wedded to another Eve,<br/>

Shall live with her enjoying, I extinct;<br/>

A death to think!  Confirmed then I resolve,<br/>

Adam shall share with me in bliss or woe:<br/>

So dear I love him, that with him all deaths<br/>

I could endure, without him live no life.<br/>

So saying, from the tree her step she turned;<br/>

But first low reverence done, as to the Power<br/>

That dwelt within, whose presence had infused<br/>

Into the plant sciential sap, derived<br/>

From nectar, drink of Gods.  Adam the while,<br/>

Waiting desirous her return, had wove<br/>

Of choicest flowers a garland, to adorn<br/>

Her tresses, and her rural labours crown;<br/>

As reapers oft are wont their harvest-queen.<br/>

Great joy he promised to his thoughts, and new<br/>

Solace in her return, so long delayed:<br/>

Yet oft his heart, divine of something ill,<br/>

Misgave him; he the faltering measure felt;<br/>

And forth to meet her went, the way she took<br/>

That morn when first they parted: by the tree<br/>

Of knowledge he must pass; there he her met,<br/>

Scarce from the tree returning; in her hand<br/>

A bough of fairest fruit, that downy smiled,<br/>

New gathered, and ambrosial smell diffused.<br/>

To him she hasted; in her face excuse<br/>

Came prologue, and apology too prompt;<br/>

Which, with bland words at will, she thus addressed.<br/>

Hast thou not wondered, Adam, at my stay?<br/>

Thee I have missed, and thought it long, deprived<br/>

Thy presence; agony of love till now<br/>

Not felt, nor shall be twice; for never more<br/>

Mean I to try, what rash untried I sought,<br/>

The pain of absence from thy sight.  But strange<br/>

Hath been the cause, and wonderful to hear:<br/>

This tree is not, as we are told, a tree<br/>

Of danger tasted, nor to evil unknown<br/>

Opening the way, but of divine effect<br/>

To open eyes, and make them Gods who taste;<br/>

And hath been tasted such:  The serpent wise,<br/>

Or not restrained as we, or not obeying,<br/>

Hath eaten of the fruit; and is become,<br/>

Not dead, as we are threatened, but thenceforth<br/>

Endued with human voice and human sense,<br/>

Reasoning to admiration; and with me<br/>

Persuasively hath so prevailed, that I<br/>

Have also tasted, and have also found<br/>

The effects to correspond; opener mine eyes,<br/>

Dim erst, dilated spirits, ampler heart,<br/>

And growing up to Godhead; which for thee<br/>

Chiefly I sought, without thee can despise.<br/>

For bliss, as thou hast part, to me is bliss;<br/>

Tedious, unshared with thee, and odious soon.<br/>

Thou therefore also taste, that equal lot<br/>

May join us, equal joy, as equal love;<br/>

Lest, thou not tasting, different degree<br/>

Disjoin us, and I then too late renounce<br/>

Deity for thee, when Fate will not permit.<br/>

Thus Eve with countenance blithe her story told;<br/>

But in her cheek distemper flushing glowed.<br/>

On the other side Adam, soon as he heard<br/>

The fatal trespass done by Eve, amazed,<br/>

Astonied stood and blank, while horrour chill<br/>

Ran through his veins, and all his joints relaxed;<br/>

From his slack hand the garland wreathed for Eve<br/>

Down dropt, and all the faded roses shed:<br/>

Speechless he stood and pale, till thus at length<br/>

First to himself he inward silence broke.<br/>

O fairest of Creation, last and best<br/>

Of all God's works, Creature in whom excelled<br/>

Whatever can to sight or thought be formed,<br/>

Holy, divine, good, amiable, or sweet!<br/>

How art thou lost! how on a sudden lost,<br/>

Defaced, deflowered, and now to death devote!<br/>

Rather, how hast thou yielded to transgress<br/>

The strict forbiddance, how to violate<br/>

The sacred fruit forbidden!  Some cursed fraud<br/>

Of enemy hath beguiled thee, yet unknown,<br/>

And me with thee hath ruined; for with thee<br/>

Certain my resolution is to die:<br/>

How can I live without thee! how forego<br/>

Thy sweet converse, and love so dearly joined,<br/>

To live again in these wild woods forlorn!<br/>

Should God create another Eve, and I<br/>

Another rib afford, yet loss of thee<br/>

Would never from my heart: no, no! I feel<br/>

The link of Nature draw me: flesh of flesh,<br/>

Bone of my bone thou art, and from thy state<br/>

Mine never shall be parted, bliss or woe.<br/>

So having said, as one from sad dismay<br/>

Recomforted, and after thoughts disturbed<br/>

Submitting to what seemed remediless,<br/>

Thus in calm mood his words to Eve he turned.<br/>

Bold deed thou hast presumed, adventurous Eve,<br/>

And peril great provoked, who thus hast dared,<br/>

Had it been only coveting to eye<br/>

That sacred fruit, sacred to abstinence,<br/>

Much more to taste it under ban to touch.<br/>

But past who can recall, or done undo?<br/>

Not God Omnipotent, nor Fate; yet so<br/>

Perhaps thou shalt not die, perhaps the fact<br/>

Is not so heinous now, foretasted fruit,<br/>

Profaned first by the serpent, by him first<br/>

Made common, and unhallowed, ere our taste;<br/>

Nor yet on him found deadly; yet he lives;<br/>

Lives, as thou saidst, and gains to live, as Man,<br/>

Higher degree of life; inducement strong<br/>

To us, as likely tasting to attain<br/>

Proportional ascent; which cannot be<br/>

But to be Gods, or Angels, demi-Gods.<br/>

Nor can I think that God, Creator wise,<br/>

Though threatening, will in earnest so destroy<br/>

Us his prime creatures, dignified so high,<br/>

Set over all his works; which in our fall,<br/>

For us created, needs with us must fail,<br/>

Dependant made; so God shall uncreate,<br/>

Be frustrate, do, undo, and labour lose;<br/>

Not well conceived of God, who, though his power<br/>

Creation could repeat, yet would be loth<br/>

Us to abolish, lest the Adversary<br/>

Triumph, and say; "Fickle their state whom God<br/>

Most favours; who can please him long? Me first<br/>

He ruined, now Mankind; whom will he next?"<br/>

Matter of scorn, not to be given the Foe.<br/>

However I with thee have fixed my lot,<br/>

Certain to undergo like doom:  If death<br/>

Consort with thee, death is to me as life;<br/>

So forcible within my heart I feel<br/>

The bond of Nature draw me to my own;<br/>

My own in thee, for what thou art is mine;<br/>

Our state cannot be severed; we are one,<br/>

One flesh; to lose thee were to lose myself.<br/>

So Adam; and thus Eve to him replied.<br/>

O glorious trial of exceeding love,<br/>

Illustrious evidence, example high!<br/>

Engaging me to emulate; but, short<br/>

Of thy perfection, how shall I attain,<br/>

Adam, from whose dear side I boast me sprung,<br/>

And gladly of our union hear thee speak,<br/>

One heart, one soul in both; whereof good proof<br/>

This day affords, declaring thee resolved,<br/>

Rather than death, or aught than death more dread,<br/>

Shall separate us, linked in love so dear,<br/>

To undergo with me one guilt, one crime,<br/>

If any be, of tasting this fair fruit;<br/>

Whose virtue for of good still good proceeds,<br/>

Direct, or by occasion, hath presented<br/>

This happy trial of thy love, which else<br/>

So eminently never had been known?<br/>

Were it I thought death menaced would ensue<br/>

This my attempt, I would sustain alone<br/>

The worst, and not persuade thee, rather die<br/>

Deserted, than oblige thee with a fact<br/>

Pernicious to thy peace; chiefly assured<br/>

Remarkably so late of thy so true,<br/>

So faithful, love unequalled: but I feel<br/>

Far otherwise the event; not death, but life<br/>

Augmented, opened eyes, new hopes, new joys,<br/>

Taste so divine, that what of sweet before<br/>

Hath touched my sense, flat seems to this, and harsh.<br/>

On my experience, Adam, freely taste,<br/>

And fear of death deliver to the winds.<br/>

So saying, she embraced him, and for joy<br/>

Tenderly wept; much won, that he his love<br/>

Had so ennobled, as of choice to incur<br/>

Divine displeasure for her sake, or death.<br/>

In recompence (for such compliance bad<br/>

Such recompence best merits) from the bough<br/>

She gave him of that fair enticing fruit<br/>

With liberal hand: he scrupled not to eat,<br/>

Against his better knowledge; not deceived,<br/>

But fondly overcome with female charm.<br/>

Earth trembled from her entrails, as again<br/>

In pangs; and Nature gave a second groan;<br/>

Sky loured; and, muttering thunder, some sad drops<br/>

Wept at completing of the mortal sin<br/>

Original: while Adam took no thought,<br/>

Eating his fill; nor Eve to iterate<br/>

Her former trespass feared, the more to sooth<br/>

Him with her loved society; that now,<br/>

As with new wine intoxicated both,<br/>

They swim in mirth, and fancy that they feel<br/>

Divinity within them breeding wings,<br/>

Wherewith to scorn the earth:  But that false fruit<br/>

Far other operation first displayed,<br/>

Carnal desire inflaming; he on Eve<br/>

Began to cast lascivious eyes; she him<br/>

As wantonly repaid; in lust they burn:<br/>

Till Adam thus 'gan Eve to dalliance move.<br/>

Eve, now I see thou art exact of taste,<br/>

And elegant, of sapience no small part;<br/>

Since to each meaning savour we apply,<br/>

And palate call judicious; I the praise<br/>

Yield thee, so well this day thou hast purveyed.<br/>

Much pleasure we have lost, while we abstained<br/>

From this delightful fruit, nor known till now<br/>

True relish, tasting; if such pleasure be<br/>

In things to us forbidden, it might be wished,<br/>

For this one tree had been forbidden ten.<br/>

But come, so well refreshed, now let us play,<br/>

As meet is, after such delicious fare;<br/>

For never did thy beauty, since the day<br/>

I saw thee first and wedded thee, adorned<br/>

With all perfections, so inflame my sense<br/>

With ardour to enjoy thee, fairer now<br/>

Than ever; bounty of this virtuous tree!<br/>

So said he, and forbore not glance or toy<br/>

Of amorous intent; well understood<br/>

Of Eve, whose eye darted contagious fire.<br/>

Her hand he seised; and to a shady bank,<br/>

Thick over-head with verdant roof imbowered,<br/>

He led her nothing loth; flowers were the couch,<br/>

Pansies, and violets, and asphodel,<br/>

And hyacinth;  Earth's freshest softest lap.<br/>

There they their fill of love and love's disport<br/>

Took largely, of their mutual guilt the seal,<br/>

The solace of their sin; till dewy sleep<br/>

Oppressed them, wearied with their amorous play,<br/>

Soon as the force of that fallacious fruit,<br/>

That with exhilarating vapour bland<br/>

About their spirits had played, and inmost powers<br/>

Made err, was now exhaled; and grosser sleep,<br/>

Bred of unkindly fumes, with conscious dreams<br/>

Incumbered, now had left them; up they rose<br/>

As from unrest; and, each the other viewing,<br/>

Soon found their eyes how opened, and their minds<br/>

How darkened; innocence, that as a veil<br/>

Had shadowed them from knowing ill, was gone;<br/>

Just confidence, and native righteousness,<br/>

And honour, from about them, naked left<br/>

To guilty Shame; he covered, but his robe<br/>

Uncovered more.  So rose the Danite strong,<br/>

Herculean Samson, from the harlot-lap<br/>

Of Philistean Dalilah, and waked<br/>

Shorn of his strength.  They destitute and bare<br/>

Of all their virtue:  Silent, and in face<br/>

Confounded, long they sat, as strucken mute:<br/>

Till Adam, though not less than Eve abashed,<br/>

At length gave utterance to these words constrained.<br/>

O Eve, in evil hour thou didst give ear<br/>

To that false worm, of whomsoever taught<br/>

To counterfeit Man's voice; true in our fall,<br/>

False in our promised rising; since our eyes<br/>

Opened we find indeed, and find we know<br/>

Both good and evil; good lost, and evil got;<br/>

Bad fruit of knowledge, if this be to know;<br/>

Which leaves us naked thus, of honour void,<br/>

Of innocence, of faith, of purity,<br/>

Our wonted ornaments now soiled and stained,<br/>

And in our faces evident the signs<br/>

Of foul concupiscence; whence evil store;<br/>

Even shame, the last of evils; of the first<br/>

Be sure then.—How shall I behold the face<br/>

Henceforth of God or Angel, erst with joy<br/>

And rapture so oft beheld?  Those heavenly shapes<br/>

Will dazzle now this earthly with their blaze<br/>

Insufferably bright.  O! might I here<br/>

In solitude live savage; in some glade<br/>

Obscured, where highest woods, impenetrable<br/>

To star or sun-light, spread their umbrage broad<br/>

And brown as evening:  Cover me, ye Pines!<br/>

Ye Cedars, with innumerable boughs<br/>

Hide me, where I may never see them more!—<br/>

But let us now, as in bad plight, devise<br/>

What best may for the present serve to hide<br/>

The parts of each from other, that seem most<br/>

To shame obnoxious, and unseemliest seen;<br/>

Some tree, whose broad smooth leaves together sewed,<br/>

And girded on our loins, may cover round<br/>

Those middle parts; that this new comer, Shame,<br/>

There sit not, and reproach us as unclean.<br/>

So counselled he, and both together went<br/>

Into the thickest wood; there soon they chose<br/>

The fig-tree; not that kind for fruit renowned,<br/>

But such as at this day, to Indians known,<br/>

In Malabar or Decan spreads her arms<br/>

Branching so broad and long, that in the ground<br/>

The bended twigs take root, and daughters grow<br/>

About the mother tree, a pillared shade<br/>

High over-arched, and echoing walks between:<br/>

There oft the Indian herdsman, shunning heat,<br/>

Shelters in cool, and tends his pasturing herds<br/>

At loop-holes cut through thickest shade:  Those leaves<br/>

They gathered, broad as Amazonian targe;<br/>

And, with what skill they had, together sewed,<br/>

To gird their waist; vain covering, if to hide<br/>

Their guilt and dreaded shame!  O, how unlike<br/>

To that first naked glory!  Such of late<br/>

Columbus found the American, so girt<br/>

With feathered cincture; naked else, and wild<br/>

Among the trees on isles and woody shores.<br/>

Thus fenced, and, as they thought, their shame in part<br/>

Covered, but not at rest or ease of mind,<br/>

They sat them down to weep; nor only tears<br/>

Rained at their eyes, but high winds worse within<br/>

Began to rise, high passions, anger, hate,<br/>

Mistrust, suspicion, discord; and shook sore<br/>

Their inward state of mind, calm region once<br/>

And full of peace, now tost and turbulent:<br/>

For Understanding ruled not, and the Will<br/>

Heard not her lore; both in subjection now<br/>

To sensual Appetite, who from beneath<br/>

Usurping over sovran Reason claimed<br/>

Superiour sway: From thus distempered breast,<br/>

Adam, estranged in look and altered style,<br/>

Speech intermitted thus to Eve renewed.<br/>

Would thou hadst hearkened to my words, and staid<br/>

With me, as I besought thee, when that strange<br/>

Desire of wandering, this unhappy morn,<br/>

I know not whence possessed thee; we had then<br/>

Remained still happy; not, as now, despoiled<br/>

Of all our good; shamed, naked, miserable!<br/>

Let none henceforth seek needless cause to approve<br/>

The faith they owe; when earnestly they seek<br/>

Such proof, conclude, they then begin to fail.<br/>

To whom, soon moved with touch of blame, thus Eve.<br/>

What words have passed thy lips, Adam severe!<br/>

Imputest thou that to my default, or will<br/>

Of wandering, as thou callest it, which who knows<br/>

But might as ill have happened thou being by,<br/>

Or to thyself perhaps?  Hadst thou been there,<br/>

Or here the attempt, thou couldst not have discerned<br/>

Fraud in the Serpent, speaking as he spake;<br/>

No ground of enmity between us known,<br/>

Why he should mean me ill, or seek to harm.<br/>

Was I to have never parted from thy side?<br/>

As good have grown there still a lifeless rib.<br/>

Being as I am, why didst not thou, the head,<br/>

Command me absolutely not to go,<br/>

Going into such danger, as thou saidst?<br/>

Too facile then, thou didst not much gainsay;<br/>

Nay, didst permit, approve, and fair dismiss.<br/>

Hadst thou been firm and fixed in thy dissent,<br/>

Neither had I transgressed, nor thou with me.<br/>

To whom, then first incensed, Adam replied.<br/>

Is this the love, is this the recompence<br/>

Of mine to thee, ingrateful Eve! expressed<br/>

Immutable, when thou wert lost, not I;<br/>

Who might have lived, and joyed immortal bliss,<br/>

Yet willingly chose rather death with thee?<br/>

And am I now upbraided as the cause<br/>

Of thy transgressing?  Not enough severe,<br/>

It seems, in thy restraint:  What could I more<br/>

I warned thee, I admonished thee, foretold<br/>

The danger, and the lurking enemy<br/>

That lay in wait; beyond this, had been force;<br/>

And force upon free will hath here no place.<br/>

But confidence then bore thee on; secure<br/>

Either to meet no danger, or to find<br/>

Matter of glorious trial; and perhaps<br/>

I also erred, in overmuch admiring<br/>

What seemed in thee so perfect, that I thought<br/>

No evil durst attempt thee; but I rue<br/>

The errour now, which is become my crime,<br/>

And thou the accuser.  Thus it shall befall<br/>

Him, who, to worth in women overtrusting,<br/>

Lets her will rule: restraint she will not brook;<br/>

And, left to herself, if evil thence ensue,<br/>

She first his weak indulgence will accuse.<br/>

Thus they in mutual accusation spent<br/>

The fruitless hours, but neither self-condemning;<br/>

And of their vain contest appeared no end.<br/>

Of Man, with strength entire and free will armed,<br/>

Complete to have discovered and repulsed<br/>

Whatever wiles of foe or seeming friend.<br/>

For still they knew, and ought to have still remembered,<br/>

The high injunction, not to taste that fruit,<br/>

Whoever tempted; which they not obeying,<br/>

(Incurred what could they less?) the penalty;<br/>

And, manifold in sin, deserved to fall.<br/>

Up into Heaven from Paradise in haste<br/>

The angelick guards ascended, mute, and sad,<br/>

For Man; for of his state by this they knew,<br/>

Much wondering how the subtle Fiend had stolen<br/>

Entrance unseen.  Soon as the unwelcome news<br/>

From Earth arrived at Heaven-gate, displeased<br/>

All were who heard; dim sadness did not spare<br/>

That time celestial visages, yet, mixed<br/>

With pity, violated not their bliss.<br/>

About the new-arrived, in multitudes<br/>

The ethereal people ran, to hear and know<br/>

How all befel:  They towards the throne supreme,<br/>

Accountable, made haste, to make appear,<br/>

With righteous plea, their utmost vigilance<br/>

And easily approved; when the Most High<br/>

Eternal Father, from his secret cloud,<br/>

Amidst in thunder uttered thus his voice.<br/>

Assembled Angels, and ye Powers returned<br/>

From unsuccessful charge; be not dismayed,<br/>

Nor troubled at these tidings from the earth,<br/>

Which your sincerest care could not prevent;<br/>

Foretold so lately what would come to pass,<br/>

When first this tempter crossed the gulf from Hell.<br/>

I told ye then he should prevail, and speed<br/>

On his bad errand; Man should be seduced,<br/>

And flattered out of all, believing lies<br/>

Against his Maker; no decree of mine<br/>

Concurring to necessitate his fall,<br/>

Or touch with lightest moment of impulse<br/>

His free will, to her own inclining left<br/>

In even scale.  But fallen he is; and now<br/>

What rests, but that the mortal sentence pass<br/>

On his transgression,—death denounced that day?<br/>

Which he presumes already vain and void,<br/>

Because not yet inflicted, as he feared,<br/>

By some immediate stroke; but soon shall find<br/>

Forbearance no acquittance, ere day end.<br/>

Justice shall not return as bounty scorned.<br/>

But whom send I to judge them? whom but thee,<br/>

Vicegerent Son?  To thee I have transferred<br/>

All judgement, whether in Heaven, or Earth, or Hell.<br/>

Easy it may be seen that I intend<br/>

Mercy colleague with justice, sending thee<br/>

Man's friend, his Mediator, his designed<br/>

Both ransom and Redeemer voluntary,<br/>

And destined Man himself to judge Man fallen.<br/>

So spake the Father; and, unfolding bright<br/>

Toward the right hand his glory, on the Son<br/>

Blazed forth unclouded Deity: He full<br/>

Resplendent all his Father manifest<br/>

Expressed, and thus divinely answered mild.<br/>

Father Eternal, thine is to decree;<br/>

Mine, both in Heaven and Earth, to do thy will<br/>

Supreme; that thou in me, thy Son beloved,<br/>

Mayest ever rest well pleased.  I go to judge<br/>

On earth these thy transgressours; but thou knowest,<br/>

Whoever judged, the worst on me must light,<br/>

When time shall be; for so I undertook<br/>

Before thee; and, not repenting, this obtain<br/>

Of right, that I may mitigate their doom<br/>

On me derived; yet I shall temper so<br/>

Justice with mercy, as may illustrate most<br/>

Them fully satisfied, and thee appease.<br/>

Attendance none shall need, nor train, where none<br/>

Are to behold the judgement, but the judged,<br/>

Those two; the third best absent is condemned,<br/>

Convict by flight, and rebel to all law:<br/>

Conviction to the serpent none belongs.<br/>

Thus saying, from his radiant seat he rose<br/>

Of high collateral glory: Him Thrones, and Powers,<br/>

Princedoms, and Dominations ministrant,<br/>

Accompanied to Heaven-gate; from whence<br/>

Eden, and all the coast, in prospect lay.<br/>

Down he descended straight; the speed of Gods<br/>

Time counts not, though with swiftest minutes winged.<br/>

Now was the sun in western cadence low<br/>

From noon, and gentle airs, due at their hour,<br/>

To fan the earth now waked, and usher in<br/>

The evening cool; when he, from wrath more cool,<br/>

Came the mild Judge, and Intercessour both,<br/>

To sentence Man:  The voice of God they heard<br/>

Now walking in the garden, by soft winds<br/>

Brought to their ears, while day declined; they heard,<br/>

And from his presence hid themselves among<br/>

The thickest trees, both man and wife; till God,<br/>

Approaching, thus to Adam called aloud.<br/>

Where art thou, Adam, wont with joy to meet<br/>

My coming seen far off?  I miss thee here,<br/>

Not pleased, thus entertained with solitude,<br/>

Where obvious duty ere while appeared unsought:<br/>

Or come I less conspicuous, or what change<br/>

Absents thee, or what chance detains?—Come forth!<br/>

He came; and with him Eve, more loth, though first<br/>

To offend; discountenanced both, and discomposed;<br/>

Love was not in their looks, either to God,<br/>

Or to each other; but apparent guilt,<br/>

And shame, and perturbation, and despair,<br/>

Anger, and obstinacy, and hate, and guile.<br/>

Whence Adam, faltering long, thus answered brief.<br/>

I heard thee in the garden, and of thy voice<br/>

Afraid, being naked, hid myself.  To whom<br/>

The gracious Judge without revile replied.<br/>

My voice thou oft hast heard, and hast not feared,<br/>

But still rejoiced; how is it now become<br/>

So dreadful to thee?  That thou art naked, who<br/>

Hath told thee?  Hast thou eaten of the tree,<br/>

Whereof I gave thee charge thou shouldst not eat?<br/>

To whom thus Adam sore beset replied.<br/>

O Heaven! in evil strait this day I stand<br/>

Before my Judge; either to undergo<br/>

Myself the total crime, or to accuse<br/>

My other self, the partner of my life;<br/>

Whose failing, while her faith to me remains,<br/>

I should conceal, and not expose to blame<br/>

By my complaint: but strict necessity<br/>

Subdues me, and calamitous constraint;<br/>

Lest on my head both sin and punishment,<br/>

However insupportable, be all<br/>

Devolved; though should I hold my peace, yet thou<br/>

Wouldst easily detect what I conceal.—<br/>

This Woman, whom thou madest to be my help,<br/>

And gavest me as thy perfect gift, so good,<br/>

So fit, so acceptable, so divine,<br/>

That from her hand I could suspect no ill,<br/>

And what she did, whatever in itself,<br/>

Her doing seemed to justify the deed;<br/>

She gave me of the tree, and I did eat.<br/>

To whom the Sovran Presence thus replied.<br/>

Was she thy God, that her thou didst obey<br/>

Before his voice? or was she made thy guide,<br/>

Superiour, or but equal, that to her<br/>

Thou didst resign thy manhood, and the place<br/>

Wherein God set thee above her made of thee,<br/>

And for thee, whose perfection far excelled<br/>

Hers in all real dignity?  Adorned<br/>

She was indeed, and lovely, to attract<br/>

Thy love, not thy subjection; and her gifts<br/>

Were such, as under government well seemed;<br/>

Unseemly to bear rule; which was thy part<br/>

And person, hadst thou known thyself aright.<br/>

So having said, he thus to Eve in few.<br/>

Say, Woman, what is this which thou hast done?<br/>

To whom sad Eve, with shame nigh overwhelmed,<br/>

Confessing soon, yet not before her Judge<br/>

Bold or loquacious, thus abashed replied.<br/>

The Serpent me beguiled, and I did eat.<br/>

Which when the Lord God heard, without delay<br/>

To judgement he proceeded on the accused<br/>

Serpent, though brute; unable to transfer<br/>

The guilt on him, who made him instrument<br/>

Of mischief, and polluted from the end<br/>

Of his creation; justly then accursed,<br/>

As vitiated in nature:  More to know<br/>

Concerned not Man, (since he no further knew)<br/>

Nor altered his offence; yet God at last<br/>

To Satan first in sin his doom applied,<br/>

Though in mysterious terms, judged as then best:<br/>

And on the Serpent thus his curse let fall.<br/>

Because thou hast done this, thou art accursed<br/>

Above all cattle, each beast of the field;<br/>

Upon thy belly groveling thou shalt go,<br/>

And dust shalt eat all the days of thy life.<br/>

Between thee and the woman I will put<br/>

Enmity, and between thine and her seed;<br/>

Her seed shall bruise thy head, thou bruise his heel.<br/>

So spake this oracle, then verified<br/>

When Jesus, Son of Mary, second Eve,<br/>

Saw Satan fall, like lightning, down from Heaven,<br/>

Prince of the air; then, rising from his grave<br/>

Spoiled Principalities and Powers, triumphed<br/>

In open show; and, with ascension bright,<br/>

Captivity led captive through the air,<br/>

The realm itself of Satan, long usurped;<br/>

Whom he shall tread at last under our feet;<br/>

Even he, who now foretold his fatal bruise;<br/>

And to the Woman thus his sentence turned.<br/>

Thy sorrow I will greatly multiply<br/>

By thy conception; children thou shalt bring<br/>

In sorrow forth; and to thy husband's will<br/>

Thine shall submit; he over thee shall rule.<br/>

On Adam last thus judgement he pronounced.<br/>

Because thou hast hearkened to the voice of thy wife,<br/>

And eaten of the tree, concerning which<br/>

I charged thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat thereof:<br/>

Cursed is the ground for thy sake; thou in sorrow<br/>

Shalt eat thereof, all the days of thy life;<br/>

Thorns also and thistles it shall bring thee forth<br/>

Unbid; and thou shalt eat the herb of the field;<br/>

In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread,<br/>

Till thou return unto the ground; for thou<br/>

Out of the ground wast taken, know thy birth,<br/>

For dust thou art, and shalt to dust return.<br/>

So judged he Man, both Judge and Saviour sent;<br/>

And the instant stroke of death, denounced that day,<br/>

Removed far off; then, pitying how they stood<br/>

Before him naked to the air, that now<br/>

Must suffer change, disdained not to begin<br/>

Thenceforth the form of servant to assume;<br/>

As when he washed his servants feet; so now,<br/>

As father of his family, he clad<br/>

Their nakedness with skins of beasts, or slain,<br/>

Or as the snake with youthful coat repaid;<br/>

And thought not much to clothe his enemies;<br/>

Nor he their outward only with the skins<br/>

Of beasts, but inward nakedness, much more.<br/>

Opprobrious, with his robe of righteousness,<br/>

Arraying, covered from his Father's sight.<br/>

To him with swift ascent he up returned,<br/>

Into his blissful bosom reassumed<br/>

In glory, as of old; to him appeased<br/>

All, though all-knowing, what had passed with Man<br/>

Recounted, mixing intercession sweet.<br/>

Mean while, ere thus was sinned and judged on Earth,<br/>

Within the gates of Hell sat Sin and Death,<br/>

In counterview within the gates, that now<br/>

Stood open wide, belching outrageous flame<br/>

Far into Chaos, since the Fiend passed through,<br/>

Sin opening; who thus now to Death began.<br/>

O Son, why sit we here each other viewing<br/>

Idly, while Satan, our great author, thrives<br/>

In other worlds, and happier seat provides<br/>

For us, his offspring dear?  It cannot be<br/>

But that success attends him; if mishap,<br/>

Ere this he had returned, with fury driven<br/>

By his avengers; since no place like this<br/>

Can fit his punishment, or their revenge.<br/>

Methinks I feel new strength within me rise,<br/>

Wings growing, and dominion given me large<br/>

Beyond this deep; whatever draws me on,<br/>

Or sympathy, or some connatural force,<br/>

Powerful at greatest distance to unite,<br/>

With secret amity, things of like kind,<br/>

By secretest conveyance.  Thou, my shade<br/>

Inseparable, must with me along;<br/>

For Death from Sin no power can separate.<br/>

But, lest the difficulty of passing back<br/>

Stay his return perhaps over this gulf<br/>

Impassable, impervious; let us try<br/>

Adventurous work, yet to thy power and mine<br/>

Not unagreeable, to found a path<br/>

Over this main from Hell to that new world,<br/>

Where Satan now prevails; a monument<br/>

Of merit high to all the infernal host,<br/>

Easing their passage hence, for intercourse,<br/>

Or transmigration, as their lot shall lead.<br/>

Nor can I miss the way, so strongly drawn<br/>

By this new-felt attraction and instinct.<br/>

Whom thus the meager Shadow answered soon.<br/>

Go, whither Fate, and inclination strong,<br/>

Leads thee; I shall not lag behind, nor err<br/>

The way, thou leading; such a scent I draw<br/>

Of carnage, prey innumerable, and taste<br/>

The savour of death from all things there that live:<br/>

Nor shall I to the work thou enterprisest<br/>

Be wanting, but afford thee equal aid.<br/>

So saying, with delight he snuffed the smell<br/>

Of mortal change on earth.  As when a flock<br/>

Of ravenous fowl, though many a league remote,<br/>

Against the day of battle, to a field,<br/>

Where armies lie encamped, come flying, lured<br/>

With scent of living carcasses designed<br/>

For death, the following day, in bloody fight:<br/>

So scented the grim Feature, and upturned<br/>

His nostril wide into the murky air;<br/>

Sagacious of his quarry from so far.<br/>

Then both from out Hell-gates, into the waste<br/>

Wide anarchy of Chaos, damp and dark,<br/>

Flew diverse; and with power (their power was great)<br/>

Hovering upon the waters, what they met<br/>

Solid or slimy, as in raging sea<br/>

Tost up and down, together crouded drove,<br/>

From each side shoaling towards the mouth of Hell;<br/>

As when two polar winds, blowing adverse<br/>

Upon the Cronian sea, together drive<br/>

Mountains of ice, that stop the imagined way<br/>

Beyond Petsora eastward, to the rich<br/>

Cathaian coast.  The aggregated soil<br/>

Death with his mace petrifick, cold and dry,<br/>

As with a trident, smote; and fixed as firm<br/>

As Delos, floating once; the rest his look<br/>

Bound with Gorgonian rigour not to move;<br/>

And with Asphaltick slime, broad as the gate,<br/>

Deep to the roots of Hell the gathered beach<br/>

They fastened, and the mole immense wrought on<br/>

Over the foaming deep high-arched, a bridge<br/>

Of length prodigious, joining to the wall<br/>

Immoveable of this now fenceless world,<br/>

Forfeit to Death; from hence a passage broad,<br/>

Smooth, easy, inoffensive, down to Hell.<br/>

So, if great things to small may be compared,<br/>

Xerxes, the liberty of Greece to yoke,<br/>

From Susa, his Memnonian palace high,<br/>

Came to the sea: and, over Hellespont<br/>

Bridging his way, Europe with Asia joined,<br/>

And scourged with many a stroke the indignant waves.<br/>

Now had they brought the work by wonderous art<br/>

Pontifical, a ridge of pendant rock,<br/>

Over the vexed abyss, following the track<br/>

Of Satan to the self-same place where he<br/>

First lighted from his wing, and landed safe<br/>

From out of Chaos, to the outside bare<br/>

Of this round world:  With pins of adamant<br/>

And chains they made all fast, too fast they made<br/>

And durable!  And now in little space<br/>

The confines met of empyrean Heaven,<br/>

And of this World; and, on the left hand, Hell<br/>

With long reach interposed; three several ways<br/>

In sight, to each of these three places led.<br/>

And now their way to Earth they had descried,<br/>

To Paradise first tending; when, behold!<br/>

Satan, in likeness of an Angel bright,<br/>

Betwixt the Centaur and the Scorpion steering<br/>

His zenith, while the sun in Aries rose:<br/>

Disguised he came; but those his children dear<br/>

Their parent soon discerned, though in disguise.<br/>

He, after Eve seduced, unminded slunk<br/>

Into the wood fast by; and, changing shape,<br/>

To observe the sequel, saw his guileful act<br/>

By Eve, though all unweeting, seconded<br/>

Upon her husband; saw their shame that sought<br/>

Vain covertures; but when he saw descend<br/>

The Son of God to judge them, terrified<br/>

He fled; not hoping to escape, but shun<br/>

The present; fearing, guilty, what his wrath<br/>

Might suddenly inflict; that past, returned<br/>

By night, and listening where the hapless pair<br/>

Sat in their sad discourse, and various plaint,<br/>

Thence gathered his own doom; which understood<br/>

Not instant, but of future time, with joy<br/>

And tidings fraught, to Hell he now returned;<br/>

And at the brink of Chaos, near the foot<br/>

Of this new wonderous pontifice, unhoped<br/>

Met, who to meet him came, his offspring dear.<br/>

Great joy was at their meeting, and at sight<br/>

Of that stupendous bridge his joy encreased.<br/>

Long he admiring stood, till Sin, his fair<br/>

Enchanting daughter, thus the silence broke.<br/>

O Parent, these are thy magnifick deeds,<br/>

Thy trophies! which thou viewest as not thine own;<br/>

Thou art their author, and prime architect:<br/>

For I no sooner in my heart divined,<br/>

My heart, which by a secret harmony<br/>

Still moves with thine, joined in connexion sweet,<br/>

That thou on earth hadst prospered, which thy looks<br/>

Now also evidence, but straight I felt,<br/>

Though distant from thee worlds between, yet felt,<br/>

That I must after thee, with this thy son;<br/>

Such fatal consequence unites us three!<br/>

Hell could no longer hold us in our bounds,<br/>

Nor this unvoyageable gulf obscure<br/>

Detain from following thy illustrious track.<br/>

Thou hast achieved our liberty, confined<br/>

Within Hell-gates till now; thou us impowered<br/>

To fortify thus far, and overlay,<br/>

With this portentous bridge, the dark abyss.<br/>

Thine now is all this world; thy virtue hath won<br/>

What thy hands builded not; thy wisdom gained<br/>

With odds what war hath lost, and fully avenged<br/>

Our foil in Heaven; here thou shalt monarch reign,<br/>

There didst not; there let him still victor sway,<br/>

As battle hath adjudged; from this new world<br/>

Retiring, by his own doom alienated;<br/>

And henceforth monarchy with thee divide<br/>

Of all things, parted by the empyreal bounds,<br/>

His quadrature, from thy orbicular world;<br/>

Or try thee now more dangerous to his throne.<br/>

Whom thus the Prince of darkness answered glad.<br/>

Fair Daughter, and thou Son and Grandchild both;<br/>

High proof ye now have given to be the race<br/>

Of Satan (for I glory in the name,<br/>

Antagonist of Heaven's Almighty King,)<br/>

Amply have merited of me, of all<br/>

The infernal empire, that so near Heaven's door<br/>

Triumphal with triumphal act have met,<br/>

Mine, with this glorious work; and made one realm,<br/>

Hell and this world, one realm, one continent<br/>

Of easy thorough-fare.  Therefore, while I<br/>

Descend through darkness, on your road with ease,<br/>

To my associate Powers, them to acquaint<br/>

With these successes, and with them rejoice;<br/>

You two this way, among these numerous orbs,<br/>

All yours, right down to Paradise descend;<br/>

There dwell, and reign in bliss; thence on the earth<br/>

Dominion exercise and in the air,<br/>

Chiefly on Man, sole lord of all declared;<br/>

Him first make sure your thrall, and lastly kill.<br/>

My substitutes I send ye, and create<br/>

Plenipotent on earth, of matchless might<br/>

Issuing from me: on your joint vigour now<br/>

My hold of this new kingdom all depends,<br/>

Through Sin to Death exposed by my exploit.<br/>

If your joint power prevail, the affairs of Hell<br/>

No detriment need fear; go, and be strong!<br/>

So saying he dismissed them; they with speed<br/>

Their course through thickest constellations held,<br/>

Spreading their bane; the blasted stars looked wan,<br/>

And planets, planet-struck, real eclipse<br/>

Then suffered.  The other way Satan went down<br/>

The causey to Hell-gate:  On either side<br/>

Disparted Chaos overbuilt exclaimed,<br/>

And with rebounding surge the bars assailed,<br/>

That scorned his indignation:  Through the gate,<br/>

Wide open and unguarded, Satan passed,<br/>

And all about found desolate; for those,<br/>

Appointed to sit there, had left their charge,<br/>

Flown to the upper world; the rest were all<br/>

Far to the inland retired, about the walls<br/>

Of Pandemonium; city and proud seat<br/>

Of Lucifer, so by allusion called<br/>

Of that bright star to Satan paragoned;<br/>

There kept their watch the legions, while the Grand<br/>

In council sat, solicitous what chance<br/>

Might intercept their emperour sent; so he<br/>

Departing gave command, and they observed.<br/>

As when the Tartar from his Russian foe,<br/>

By Astracan, over the snowy plains,<br/>

Retires; or Bactrin Sophi, from the horns<br/>

Of Turkish crescent, leaves all waste beyond<br/>

The realm of Aladule, in his retreat<br/>

To Tauris or Casbeen:  So these, the late<br/>

Heaven-banished host, left desart utmost Hell<br/>

Many a dark league, reduced in careful watch<br/>

Round their metropolis; and now expecting<br/>

Each hour their great adventurer, from the search<br/>

Of foreign worlds:  He through the midst unmarked,<br/>

In show plebeian Angel militant<br/>

Of lowest order, passed; and from the door<br/>

Of that Plutonian hall, invisible<br/>

Ascended his high throne; which, under state<br/>

Of richest texture spread, at the upper end<br/>

Was placed in regal lustre.  Down a while<br/>

He sat, and round about him saw unseen:<br/>

At last, as from a cloud, his fulgent head<br/>

And shape star-bright appeared, or brighter; clad<br/>

With what permissive glory since his fall<br/>

Was left him, or false glitter:  All amazed<br/>

At that so sudden blaze the Stygian throng<br/>

Bent their aspect, and whom they wished beheld,<br/>

Their mighty Chief returned: loud was the acclaim:<br/>

Forth rushed in haste the great consulting peers,<br/>

Raised from their dark Divan, and with like joy<br/>

Congratulant approached him; who with hand<br/>

Silence, and with these words attention, won.<br/>

Thrones, Dominations, Princedoms, Virtues, Powers;<br/>

For in possession such, not only of right,<br/>

I call ye, and declare ye now; returned<br/>

Successful beyond hope, to lead ye forth<br/>

Triumphant out of this infernal pit<br/>

Abominable, accursed, the house of woe,<br/>

And dungeon of our tyrant:  Now possess,<br/>

As Lords, a spacious world, to our native Heaven<br/>

Little inferiour, by my adventure hard<br/>

With peril great achieved.  Long were to tell<br/>

What I have done; what suffered; with what pain<br/>

Voyaged th' unreal, vast, unbounded deep<br/>

Of horrible confusion; over which<br/>

By Sin and Death a broad way now is paved,<br/>

To expedite your glorious march; but I<br/>

Toiled out my uncouth passage, forced to ride<br/>

The untractable abyss, plunged in the womb<br/>

Of unoriginal Night and Chaos wild;<br/>

That, jealous of their secrets, fiercely opposed<br/>

My journey strange, with clamorous uproar<br/>

Protesting Fate supreme; thence how I found<br/>

The new created world, which fame in Heaven<br/>

Long had foretold, a fabrick wonderful<br/>

Of absolute perfection! therein Man<br/>

Placed in a Paradise, by our exile<br/>

Made happy:  Him by fraud I have seduced<br/>

From his Creator; and, the more to encrease<br/>

Your wonder, with an apple; he, thereat<br/>

Offended, worth your laughter! hath given up<br/>

Both his beloved Man, and all his world,<br/>

To Sin and Death a prey, and so to us,<br/>

Without our hazard, labour, or alarm;<br/>

To range in, and to dwell, and over Man<br/>

To rule, as over all he should have ruled.<br/>

True is, me also he hath judged, or rather<br/>

Me not, but the brute serpent in whose shape<br/>

Man I deceived: that which to me belongs,<br/>

Is enmity which he will put between<br/>

Me and mankind; I am to bruise his heel;<br/>

His seed, when is not set, shall bruise my head:<br/>

A world who would not purchase with a bruise,<br/>

Or much more grievous pain?—Ye have the account<br/>

Of my performance:  What remains, ye Gods,<br/>

But up, and enter now into full bliss?<br/>

So having said, a while he stood, expecting<br/>

Their universal shout, and high applause,<br/>

To fill his ear; when, contrary, he hears<br/>

On all sides, from innumerable tongues,<br/>

A dismal universal hiss, the sound<br/>

Of publick scorn; he wondered, but not long<br/>

Had leisure, wondering at himself now more,<br/>

His visage drawn he felt to sharp and spare;<br/>

His arms clung to his ribs; his legs entwining<br/>

Each other, till supplanted down he fell<br/>

A monstrous serpent on his belly prone,<br/>

Reluctant, but in vain; a greater power<br/>

Now ruled him, punished in the shape he sinned,<br/>

According to his doom: he would have spoke,<br/>

But hiss for hiss returned with forked tongue<br/>

To forked tongue; for now were all transformed<br/>

Alike, to serpents all, as accessories<br/>

To his bold riot:  Dreadful was the din<br/>

Of hissing through the hall, thick swarming now<br/>

With complicated monsters head and tail,<br/>

Scorpion, and Asp, and Amphisbaena dire,<br/>

Cerastes horned, Hydrus, and Elops drear,<br/>

And Dipsas; (not so thick swarmed once the soil<br/>

Bedropt with blood of Gorgon, or the isle<br/>

Ophiusa,) but still greatest he the midst,<br/>

Now Dragon grown, larger than whom the sun<br/>

Ingendered in the Pythian vale or slime,<br/>

Huge Python, and his power no less he seemed<br/>

Above the rest still to retain; they all<br/>

Him followed, issuing forth to the open field,<br/>

Where all yet left of that revolted rout,<br/>

Heaven-fallen, in station stood or just array;<br/>

Sublime with expectation when to see<br/>

In triumph issuing forth their glorious Chief;<br/>

They saw, but other sight instead! a croud<br/>

Of ugly serpents; horrour on them fell,<br/>

And horrid sympathy; for, what they saw,<br/>

They felt themselves, now changing; down their arms,<br/>

Down fell both spear and shield; down they as fast;<br/>

And the dire hiss renewed, and the dire form<br/>

Catched, by contagion; like in punishment,<br/>

As in their crime.  Thus was the applause they meant,<br/>

Turned to exploding hiss, triumph to shame<br/>

Cast on themselves from their own mouths.  There stood<br/>

A grove hard by, sprung up with this their change,<br/>

His will who reigns above, to aggravate<br/>

Their penance, laden with fair fruit, like that<br/>

Which grew in Paradise, the bait of Eve<br/>

Used by the Tempter: on that prospect strange<br/>

Their earnest eyes they fixed, imagining<br/>

For one forbidden tree a multitude<br/>

Now risen, to work them further woe or shame;<br/>

Yet, parched with scalding thirst and hunger fierce,<br/>

Though to delude them sent, could not abstain;<br/>

But on they rolled in heaps, and, up the trees<br/>

Climbing, sat thicker than the snaky locks<br/>

That curled Megaera: greedily they plucked<br/>

The fruitage fair to sight, like that which grew<br/>

Near that bituminous lake where Sodom flamed;<br/>

This more delusive, not the touch, but taste<br/>

Deceived; they, fondly thinking to allay<br/>

Their appetite with gust, instead of fruit<br/>

Chewed bitter ashes, which the offended taste<br/>

With spattering noise rejected: oft they assayed,<br/>

Hunger and thirst constraining; drugged as oft,<br/>

With hatefullest disrelish writhed their jaws,<br/>

With soot and cinders filled; so oft they fell<br/>

Into the same illusion, not as Man<br/>

Whom they triumphed once lapsed.  Thus were they plagued<br/>

And worn with famine, long and ceaseless hiss,<br/>

Till their lost shape, permitted, they resumed;<br/>

Yearly enjoined, some say, to undergo,<br/>

This annual humbling certain numbered days,<br/>

To dash their pride, and joy, for Man seduced.<br/>

However, some tradition they dispersed<br/>

Among the Heathen, of their purchase got,<br/>

And fabled how the Serpent, whom they called<br/>

Ophion, with Eurynome, the wide—<br/>

Encroaching Eve perhaps, had first the rule<br/>

Of high Olympus; thence by Saturn driven<br/>

And Ops, ere yet Dictaean Jove was born.<br/>

Mean while in Paradise the hellish pair<br/>

Too soon arrived; Sin, there in power before,<br/>

Once actual; now in body, and to dwell<br/>

Habitual habitant; behind her Death,<br/>

Close following pace for pace, not mounted yet<br/>

On his pale horse: to whom Sin thus began.<br/>

Second of Satan sprung, all-conquering Death!<br/>

What thinkest thou of our empire now, though earned<br/>

With travel difficult, not better far<br/>

Than still at Hell's dark threshold to have sat watch,<br/>

Unnamed, undreaded, and thyself half starved?<br/>

Whom thus the Sin-born monster answered soon.<br/>

To me, who with eternal famine pine,<br/>

Alike is Hell, or Paradise, or Heaven;<br/>

There best, where most with ravine I may meet;<br/>

Which here, though plenteous, all too little seems<br/>

To stuff this maw, this vast unhide-bound corps.<br/>

To whom the incestuous mother thus replied.<br/>

Thou therefore on these herbs, and fruits, and flowers,<br/>

Feed first; on each beast next, and fish, and fowl;<br/>

No homely morsels! and, whatever thing<br/>

The sithe of Time mows down, devour unspared;<br/>

Till I, in Man residing, through the race,<br/>

His thoughts, his looks, words, actions, all infect;<br/>

And season him thy last and sweetest prey.<br/>

This said, they both betook them several ways,<br/>

Both to destroy, or unimmortal make<br/>

All kinds, and for destruction to mature<br/>

Sooner or later; which the Almighty seeing,<br/>

From his transcendent seat the Saints among,<br/>

To those bright Orders uttered thus his voice.<br/>

See, with what heat these dogs of Hell advance<br/>

To waste and havock yonder world, which I<br/>

So fair and good created; and had still<br/>

Kept in that state, had not the folly of Man<br/>

Let in these wasteful furies, who impute<br/>

Folly to me; so doth the Prince of Hell<br/>

And his adherents, that with so much ease<br/>

I suffer them to enter and possess<br/>

A place so heavenly; and, conniving, seem<br/>

To gratify my scornful enemies,<br/>

That laugh, as if, transported with some fit<br/>

Of passion, I to them had quitted all,<br/>

At random yielded up to their misrule;<br/>

And know not that I called, and drew them thither,<br/>

My Hell-hounds, to lick up the draff and filth<br/>

Which Man's polluting sin with taint hath shed<br/>

On what was pure; til, crammed and gorged, nigh burst<br/>

With sucked and glutted offal, at one sling<br/>

Of thy victorious arm, well-pleasing Son,<br/>

Both Sin, and Death, and yawning Grave, at last,<br/>

Through Chaos hurled, obstruct the mouth of Hell<br/>

For ever, and seal up his ravenous jaws.<br/>

Then Heaven and Earth renewed shall be made pure<br/>

To sanctity, that shall receive no stain:<br/>

Till then, the curse pronounced on both precedes.<br/>

He ended, and the heavenly audience loud<br/>

Sung Halleluiah, as the sound of seas,<br/>

Through multitude that sung:  Just are thy ways,<br/>

Righteous are thy decrees on all thy works;<br/>

Who can extenuate thee?  Next, to the Son,<br/>

Destined Restorer of mankind, by whom<br/>

New Heaven and Earth shall to the ages rise,<br/>

Or down from Heaven descend.—Such was their song;<br/>

While the Creator, calling forth by name<br/>

His mighty Angels, gave them several charge,<br/>

As sorted best with present things.  The sun<br/>

Had first his precept so to move, so shine,<br/>

As might affect the earth with cold and heat<br/>

Scarce tolerable; and from the north to call<br/>

Decrepit winter; from the south to bring<br/>

Solstitial summer's heat.  To the blanc moon<br/>

Her office they prescribed; to the other five<br/>

Their planetary motions, and aspects,<br/>

In sextile, square, and trine, and opposite,<br/>

Of noxious efficacy, and when to join<br/>

In synod unbenign; and taught the fixed<br/>

Their influence malignant when to shower,<br/>

Which of them rising with the sun, or falling,<br/>

Should prove tempestuous:  To the winds they set<br/>

Their corners, when with bluster to confound<br/>

Sea, air, and shore; the thunder when to roll<br/>

With terrour through the dark aereal hall.<br/>

Some say, he bid his Angels turn ascanse<br/>

The poles of earth, twice ten degrees and more,<br/>

From the sun's axle; they with labour pushed<br/>

Oblique the centrick globe:  Some say, the sun<br/>

Was bid turn reins from the equinoctial road<br/>

Like distant breadth to Taurus with the seven<br/>

Atlantick Sisters, and the Spartan Twins,<br/>

Up to the Tropick Crab: thence down amain<br/>

By Leo, and the Virgin, and the Scales,<br/>

As deep as Capricorn; to bring in change<br/>

Of seasons to each clime; else had the spring<br/>

Perpetual smiled on earth with vernant flowers,<br/>

Equal in days and nights, except to those<br/>

Beyond the polar circles; to them day<br/>

Had unbenighted shone, while the low sun,<br/>

To recompense his distance, in their sight<br/>

Had rounded still the horizon, and not known<br/>

Or east or west; which had forbid the snow<br/>

From cold Estotiland, and south as far<br/>

Beneath Magellan.  At that tasted fruit<br/>

The sun, as from Thyestean banquet, turned<br/>

His course intended; else, how had the world<br/>

Inhabited, though sinless, more than now,<br/>

Avoided pinching cold and scorching heat?<br/>

These changes in the Heavens, though slow, produced<br/>

Like change on sea and land; sideral blast,<br/>

Vapour, and mist, and exhalation hot,<br/>

Corrupt and pestilent:  Now from the north<br/>

Of Norumbega, and the Samoed shore,<br/>

Bursting their brazen dungeon, armed with ice,<br/>

And snow, and hail, and stormy gust and flaw,<br/>

Boreas, and Caecias, and Argestes loud,<br/>

And Thrascias, rend the woods, and seas upturn;<br/>

With adverse blast upturns them from the south<br/>

Notus, and Afer black with thunderous clouds<br/>

From Serraliona; thwart of these, as fierce,<br/>

Forth rush the Levant and the Ponent winds,<br/>

Eurus and Zephyr, with their lateral noise,<br/>

Sirocco and Libecchio.  Thus began<br/>

Outrage from lifeless things; but Discord first,<br/>

Daughter of Sin, among the irrational<br/>

Death introduced, through fierce antipathy:<br/>

Beast now with beast 'gan war, and fowl with fowl,<br/>

And fish with fish; to graze the herb all leaving,<br/>

Devoured each other; nor stood much in awe<br/>

Of Man, but fled him; or, with countenance grim,<br/>

Glared on him passing.  These were from without<br/>

The growing miseries, which Adam saw<br/>

Already in part, though hid in gloomiest shade,<br/>

To sorrow abandoned, but worse felt within;<br/>

And, in a troubled sea of passion tost,<br/>

Thus to disburden sought with sad complaint.<br/>

O miserable of happy!  Is this the end<br/>

Of this new glorious world, and me so late<br/>

The glory of that glory, who now become<br/>

Accursed, of blessed? hide me from the face<br/>

Of God, whom to behold was then my highth<br/>

Of happiness!—Yet well, if here would end<br/>

The misery; I deserved it, and would bear<br/>

My own deservings; but this will not serve:<br/>

All that I eat or drink, or shall beget,<br/>

Is propagated curse.  O voice, once heard<br/>

Delightfully, Encrease and multiply;<br/>

Now death to hear! for what can I encrease,<br/>

Or multiply, but curses on my head?<br/>

Who of all ages to succeed, but, feeling<br/>

The evil on him brought by me, will curse<br/>

My head?  Ill fare our ancestor impure,<br/>

For this we may thank Adam! but his thanks<br/>

Shall be the execration: so, besides<br/>

Mine own that bide upon me, all from me<br/>

Shall with a fierce reflux on me rebound;<br/>

On me, as on their natural center, light<br/>

Heavy, though in their place.  O fleeting joys<br/>

Of Paradise, dear bought with lasting woes!<br/>

Did I request thee, Maker, from my clay<br/>

To mould me Man? did I solicit thee<br/>

From darkness to promote me, or here place<br/>

In this delicious garden?  As my will<br/>

Concurred not to my being, it were but right<br/>

And equal to reduce me to my dust;<br/>

Desirous to resign and render back<br/>

All I received; unable to perform<br/>

Thy terms too hard, by which I was to hold<br/>

The good I sought not.  To the loss of that,<br/>

Sufficient penalty, why hast thou added<br/>

The sense of endless woes?  Inexplicable<br/>

Thy justice seems; yet to say truth, too late<br/>

I thus contest; then should have been refused<br/>

Those terms whatever, when they were proposed:<br/>

Thou didst accept them; wilt thou enjoy the good,<br/>

Then cavil the conditions?  And, though God<br/>

Made thee without thy leave, what if thy son<br/>

Prove disobedient, and reproved, retort,<br/>

"Wherefore didst thou beget me? I sought it not!"<br/>

Wouldst thou admit for his contempt of thee<br/>

That proud excuse? yet him not thy election,<br/>

But natural necessity begot.<br/>

God made thee of choice his own, and of his own<br/>

To serve him; thy reward was of his grace;<br/>

Thy punishment then, justly is at his will.<br/>

Be it so, for I submit; his doom is fair,<br/>

That dust I am, and shall to dust return.<br/>

O welcome hour whenever! Why delays<br/>

His hand to execute what his decree<br/>

Fixed on this day? Why do I overlive,<br/>

Why am I mocked with death, and lengthened out<br/>

To deathless pain?  How gladly would I meet<br/>

Mortality my sentence, and be earth<br/>

Insensible!  How glad would lay me down<br/>

As in my mother's lap!  There I should rest,<br/>

And sleep secure; his dreadful voice no more<br/>

Would thunder in my ears; no fear of worse<br/>

To me, and to my offspring, would torment me<br/>

With cruel expectation.  Yet one doubt<br/>

Pursues me still, lest all I cannot die;<br/>

Lest that pure breath of life, the spirit of Man<br/>

Which God inspired, cannot together perish<br/>

With this corporeal clod; then, in the grave,<br/>

Or in some other dismal place, who knows<br/>

But I shall die a living death?  O thought<br/>

Horrid, if true!  Yet why? It was but breath<br/>

Of life that sinned; what dies but what had life<br/>

And sin?  The body properly had neither,<br/>

All of me then shall die: let this appease<br/>

The doubt, since human reach no further knows.<br/>

For though the Lord of all be infinite,<br/>

Is his wrath also?  Be it, Man is not so,<br/>

But mortal doomed.  How can he exercise<br/>

Wrath without end on Man, whom death must end?<br/>

Can he make deathless death?  That were to make<br/>

Strange contradiction, which to God himself<br/>

Impossible is held; as argument<br/>

Of weakness, not of power.  Will he draw out,<br/>

For anger's sake, finite to infinite,<br/>

In punished Man, to satisfy his rigour,<br/>

Satisfied never?  That were to extend<br/>

His sentence beyond dust and Nature's law;<br/>

By which all causes else, according still<br/>

To the reception of their matter, act;<br/>

Not to the extent of their own sphere.  But say<br/>

That death be not one stroke, as I supposed,<br/>

Bereaving sense, but endless misery<br/>

From this day onward; which I feel begun<br/>

Both in me, and without me; and so last<br/>

To perpetuity;—Ay me! that fear<br/>

Comes thundering back with dreadful revolution<br/>

On my defenceless head; both Death and I<br/>

Am found eternal, and incorporate both;<br/>

Nor I on my part single; in me all<br/>

Posterity stands cursed:  Fair patrimony<br/>

That I must leave ye, Sons!  O, were I able<br/>

To waste it all myself, and leave ye none!<br/>

So disinherited, how would you bless<br/>

Me, now your curse!  Ah, why should all mankind,<br/>

For one man's fault, thus guiltless be condemned,<br/>

It guiltless?  But from me what can proceed,<br/>

But all corrupt; both mind and will depraved<br/>

Not to do only, but to will the same<br/>

With me?  How can they then acquitted stand<br/>

In sight of God?  Him, after all disputes,<br/>

Forced I absolve: all my evasions vain,<br/>

And reasonings, though through mazes, lead me still<br/>

But to my own conviction: first and last<br/>

On me, me only, as the source and spring<br/>

Of all corruption, all the blame lights due;<br/>

So might the wrath!  Fond wish! couldst thou support<br/>

That burden, heavier than the earth to bear;<br/>

Than all the world much heavier, though divided<br/>

With that bad Woman?  Thus, what thou desirest,<br/>

And what thou fearest, alike destroys all hope<br/>

Of refuge, and concludes thee miserable<br/>

Beyond all past example and future;<br/>

To Satan only like both crime and doom.<br/>

O Conscience! into what abyss of fears<br/>

And horrours hast thou driven me; out of which<br/>

I find no way, from deep to deeper plunged!<br/>

Thus Adam to himself lamented loud,<br/>

Through the still night; not now, as ere Man fell,<br/>

Wholesome, and cool, and mild, but with black air<br/>

Accompanied; with damps, and dreadful gloom;<br/>

Which to his evil conscience represented<br/>

All things with double terrour:  On the ground<br/>

Outstretched he lay, on the cold ground; and oft<br/>

Cursed his creation;  Death as oft accused<br/>

Of tardy execution, since denounced<br/>

The day of his offence.  Why comes not Death,<br/>

Said he, with one thrice-acceptable stroke<br/>

To end me?  Shall Truth fail to keep her word,<br/>

Justice Divine not hasten to be just?<br/>

But Death comes not at call; Justice Divine<br/>

Mends not her slowest pace for prayers or cries,<br/>

O woods, O fountains, hillocks, dales, and bowers!<br/>

With other echo late I taught your shades<br/>

To answer, and resound far other song.—<br/>

Whom thus afflicted when sad Eve beheld,<br/>

Desolate where she sat, approaching nigh,<br/>

Soft words to his fierce passion she assayed:<br/>

But her with stern regard he thus repelled.<br/>

Out of my sight, thou Serpent!  That name best<br/>

Befits thee with him leagued, thyself as false<br/>

And hateful; nothing wants, but that thy shape,<br/>

Like his, and colour serpentine, may show<br/>

Thy inward fraud; to warn all creatures from thee<br/>

Henceforth; lest that too heavenly form, pretended<br/>

To hellish falshood, snare them!  But for thee<br/>

I had persisted happy; had not thy pride<br/>

And wandering vanity, when least was safe,<br/>

Rejected my forewarning, and disdained<br/>

Not to be trusted; longing to be seen,<br/>

Though by the Devil himself; him overweening<br/>

To over-reach; but, with the serpent meeting,<br/>

Fooled and beguiled; by him thou, I by thee<br/>

To trust thee from my side; imagined wise,<br/>

Constant, mature, proof against all assaults;<br/>

And understood not all was but a show,<br/>

Rather than solid virtue; all but a rib<br/>

Crooked by nature, bent, as now appears,<br/>

More to the part sinister, from me drawn;<br/>

Well if thrown out, as supernumerary<br/>

To my just number found.  O! why did God,<br/>

Creator wise, that peopled highest Heaven<br/>

With Spirits masculine, create at last<br/>

This novelty on earth, this fair defect<br/>

Of nature, and not fill the world at once<br/>

With Men, as Angels, without feminine;<br/>

Or find some other way to generate<br/>

Mankind?  This mischief had not been befallen,<br/>

And more that shall befall; innumerable<br/>

Disturbances on earth through female snares,<br/>

And strait conjunction with this sex: for either<br/>

He never shall find out fit mate, but such<br/>

As some misfortune brings him, or mistake;<br/>

Or whom he wishes most shall seldom gain<br/>

Through her perverseness, but shall see her gained<br/>

By a far worse; or, if she love, withheld<br/>

By parents; or his happiest choice too late<br/>

Shall meet, already linked and wedlock-bound<br/>

To a fell adversary, his hate or shame:<br/>

Which infinite calamity shall cause<br/>

To human life, and houshold peace confound.<br/>

He added not, and from her turned; but Eve,<br/>

Not so repulsed, with tears that ceased not flowing<br/>

And tresses all disordered, at his feet<br/>

Fell humble; and, embracing them, besought<br/>

His peace, and thus proceeded in her plaint.<br/>

Forsake me not thus, Adam! witness Heaven<br/>

What love sincere, and reverence in my heart<br/>

I bear thee, and unweeting have offended,<br/>

Unhappily deceived!  Thy suppliant<br/>

I beg, and clasp thy knees; bereave me not,<br/>

Whereon I live, thy gentle looks, thy aid,<br/>

Thy counsel, in this uttermost distress,<br/>

My only strength and stay:  Forlorn of thee,<br/>

Whither shall I betake me, where subsist?<br/>

While yet we live, scarce one short hour perhaps,<br/>

Between us two let there be peace; both joining,<br/>

As joined in injuries, one enmity<br/>

Against a foe by doom express assigned us,<br/>

That cruel Serpent:  On me exercise not<br/>

Thy hatred for this misery befallen;<br/>

On me already lost, me than thyself<br/>

More miserable!  Both have sinned; but thou<br/>

Against God only; I against God and thee;<br/>

And to the place of judgement will return,<br/>

There with my cries importune Heaven; that all<br/>

The sentence, from thy head removed, may light<br/>

On me, sole cause to thee of all this woe;<br/>

Me, me only, just object of his ire!<br/>

She ended weeping; and her lowly plight,<br/>

Immoveable, till peace obtained from fault<br/>

Acknowledged and deplored, in Adam wrought<br/>

Commiseration:  Soon his heart relented<br/>

Towards her, his life so late, and sole delight,<br/>

Now at his feet submissive in distress;<br/>

Creature so fair his reconcilement seeking,<br/>

His counsel, whom she had displeased, his aid:<br/>

As one disarmed, his anger all he lost,<br/>

And thus with peaceful words upraised her soon.<br/>

Unwary, and too desirous, as before,<br/>

So now of what thou knowest not, who desirest<br/>

The punishment all on thyself; alas!<br/>

Bear thine own first, ill able to sustain<br/>

His full wrath, whose thou feelest as yet least part,<br/>

And my displeasure bearest so ill.  If prayers<br/>

Could alter high decrees, I to that place<br/>

Would speed before thee, and be louder heard,<br/>

That on my head all might be visited;<br/>

Thy frailty and infirmer sex forgiven,<br/>

To me committed, and by me exposed.<br/>

But rise;—let us no more contend, nor blame<br/>

Each other, blamed enough elsewhere; but strive<br/>

In offices of love, how we may lighten<br/>

Each other's burden, in our share of woe;<br/>

Since this day's death denounced, if aught I see,<br/>

Will prove no sudden, but a slow-paced evil;<br/>

A long day's dying, to augment our pain;<br/>

And to our seed (O hapless seed!) derived.<br/>

To whom thus Eve, recovering heart, replied.<br/>

Adam, by sad experiment I know<br/>

How little weight my words with thee can find,<br/>

Found so erroneous; thence by just event<br/>

Found so unfortunate:  Nevertheless,<br/>

Restored by thee, vile as I am, to place<br/>

Of new acceptance, hopeful to regain<br/>

Thy love, the sole contentment of my heart<br/>

Living or dying, from thee I will not hide<br/>

What thoughts in my unquiet breast are risen,<br/>

Tending to some relief of our extremes,<br/>

Or end; though sharp and sad, yet tolerable,<br/>

As in our evils, and of easier choice.<br/>

If care of our descent perplex us most,<br/>

Which must be born to certain woe, devoured<br/>

By Death at last; and miserable it is<br/>

To be to others cause of misery,<br/>

Our own begotten, and of our loins to bring<br/>

Into this cursed world a woeful race,<br/>

That after wretched life must be at last<br/>

Food for so foul a monster; in thy power<br/>

It lies, yet ere conception to prevent<br/>

The race unblest, to being yet unbegot.<br/>

Childless thou art, childless remain: so Death<br/>

Shall be deceived his glut, and with us two<br/>

Be forced to satisfy his ravenous maw.<br/>

But if thou judge it hard and difficult,<br/>

Conversing, looking, loving, to abstain<br/>

From love's due rights, nuptial embraces sweet;<br/>

And with desire to languish without hope,<br/>

Before the present object languishing<br/>

With like desire; which would be misery<br/>

And torment less than none of what we dread;<br/>

Then, both ourselves and seed at once to free<br/>

From what we fear for both, let us make short,—<br/>

Let us seek Death;—or, he not found, supply<br/>

With our own hands his office on ourselves:<br/>

Why stand we longer shivering under fears,<br/>

That show no end but death, and have the power,<br/>

Of many ways to die the shortest choosing,<br/>

Destruction with destruction to destroy?—<br/>

She ended here, or vehement despair<br/>

Broke off the rest: so much of death her thoughts<br/>

Had entertained, as dyed her cheeks with pale.<br/>

But Adam, with such counsel nothing swayed,<br/>

To better hopes his more attentive mind<br/>

Labouring had raised; and thus to Eve replied.<br/>

Eve, thy contempt of life and pleasure seems<br/>

To argue in thee something more sublime<br/>

And excellent, than what thy mind contemns;<br/>

But self-destruction therefore sought, refutes<br/>

That excellence thought in thee; and implies,<br/>

Not thy contempt, but anguish and regret<br/>

For loss of life and pleasure overloved.<br/>

Or if thou covet death, as utmost end<br/>

Of misery, so thinking to evade<br/>

The penalty pronounced; doubt not but God<br/>

Hath wiselier armed his vengeful ire, than so<br/>

To be forestalled; much more I fear lest death,<br/>

So snatched, will not exempt us from the pain<br/>

We are by doom to pay; rather, such acts<br/>

Of contumacy will provoke the Highest<br/>

To make death in us live:  Then let us seek<br/>

Some safer resolution, which methinks<br/>

I have in view, calling to mind with heed<br/>

Part of our sentence, that thy seed shall bruise<br/>

The Serpent's head; piteous amends! unless<br/>

Be meant, whom I conjecture, our grand foe,<br/>

Satan; who, in the serpent, hath contrived<br/>

Against us this deceit:  To crush his head<br/>

Would be revenge indeed! which will be lost<br/>

By death brought on ourselves, or childless days<br/>

Resolved, as thou proposest; so our foe<br/>

Shal 'scape his punishment ordained, and we<br/>

Instead shall double ours upon our heads.<br/>

No more be mentioned then of violence<br/>

Against ourselves; and wilful barrenness,<br/>

That cuts us off from hope; and savours only<br/>

Rancour and pride, impatience and despite,<br/>

Reluctance against God and his just yoke<br/>

Laid on our necks.  Remember with what mild<br/>

And gracious temper he both heard, and judged,<br/>

Without wrath or reviling; we expected<br/>

Immediate dissolution, which we thought<br/>

Was meant by death that day; when lo! to thee<br/>

Pains only in child-bearing were foretold,<br/>

And bringing forth; soon recompensed with joy,<br/>

Fruit of thy womb:  On me the curse aslope<br/>

Glanced on the ground; with labour I must earn<br/>

My bread; what harm? Idleness had been worse;<br/>

My labour will sustain me; and, lest cold<br/>

Or heat should injure us, his timely care<br/>

Hath, unbesought, provided; and his hands<br/>

Clothed us unworthy, pitying while he judged;<br/>

How much more, if we pray him, will his ear<br/>

Be open, and his heart to pity incline,<br/>

And teach us further by what means to shun<br/>

The inclement seasons, rain, ice, hail, and snow!<br/>

Which now the sky, with various face, begins<br/>

To show us in this mountain; while the winds<br/>

Blow moist and keen, shattering the graceful locks<br/>

Of these fair spreading trees; which bids us seek<br/>

Some better shroud, some better warmth to cherish<br/>

Our limbs benummed, ere this diurnal star<br/>

Leave cold the night, how we his gathered beams<br/>

Reflected may with matter sere foment;<br/>

Or, by collision of two bodies, grind<br/>

The air attrite to fire; as late the clouds<br/>

Justling, or pushed with winds, rude in their shock,<br/>

Tine the slant lightning; whose thwart flame, driven down<br/>

Kindles the gummy bark of fir or pine;<br/>

And sends a comfortable heat from far,<br/>

Which might supply the sun:  Such fire to use,<br/>

And what may else be remedy or cure<br/>

To evils which our own misdeeds have wrought,<br/>

He will instruct us praying, and of grace<br/>

Beseeching him; so as we need not fear<br/>

To pass commodiously this life, sustained<br/>

By him with many comforts, till we end<br/>

In dust, our final rest and native home.<br/>

What better can we do, than, to the place<br/>

Repairing where he judged us, prostrate fall<br/>

Before him reverent; and there confess<br/>

Humbly our faults, and pardon beg; with tears<br/>

Watering the ground, and with our sighs the air<br/>

Frequenting, sent from hearts contrite, in sign<br/>

Of sorrow unfeigned, and humiliation meek.<br/>

Undoubtedly he will relent, and turn<br/>

From his displeasure; in whose look serene,<br/>

When angry most he seemed and most severe,<br/>

What else but favour, grace, and mercy, shone?<br/>

So spake our father penitent; nor Eve<br/>

Felt less remorse: they, forthwith to the place<br/>

Repairing where he judged them, prostrate fell<br/>

Before him reverent; and both confessed<br/>

Humbly their faults, and pardon begged; with tears<br/>

Watering the ground, and with their sighs the air<br/>

Frequenting, sent from hearts contrite, in sign<br/>

Of sorrow unfeigned, and humiliation meek.<br/>

<h3 id="id00036" style="margin-top: 3em">Book XI</h3>
<p id="id00037" style="margin-top: 2em">Thus they, in lowliest plight, repentant stood<br/>

Praying; for from the mercy-seat above<br/>

Prevenient grace descending had removed<br/>

The stony from their hearts, and made new flesh<br/>

Regenerate grow instead; that sighs now breathed<br/>

Unutterable; which the Spirit of prayer<br/>

Inspired, and winged for Heaven with speedier flight<br/>

Than loudest oratory:  Yet their port<br/>

Not of mean suitors; nor important less<br/>

Seemed their petition, than when the ancient pair<br/>

In fables old, less ancient yet than these,<br/>

Deucalion and chaste Pyrrha, to restore<br/>

The race of mankind drowned, before the shrine<br/>

Of Themis stood devout.  To Heaven their prayers<br/>

Flew up, nor missed the way, by envious winds<br/>

Blown vagabond or frustrate: in they passed<br/>

Dimensionless through heavenly doors; then clad<br/>

With incense, where the golden altar fumed,<br/>

By their great intercessour, came in sight<br/>

Before the Father's throne: them the glad Son<br/>

Presenting, thus to intercede began.<br/>

See Father, what first-fruits on earth are sprung<br/>

From thy implanted grace in Man; these sighs<br/>

And prayers, which in this golden censer mixed<br/>

With incense, I thy priest before thee bring;<br/>

Fruits of more pleasing savour, from thy seed<br/>

Sown with contrition in his heart, than those<br/>

Which, his own hand manuring, all the trees<br/>

Of Paradise could have produced, ere fallen<br/>

From innocence.  Now therefore, bend thine ear<br/>

To supplication; hear his sighs, though mute;<br/>

Unskilful with what words to pray, let me<br/>

Interpret for him; me, his advocate<br/>

And propitiation; all his works on me,<br/>

Good, or not good, ingraft; my merit those<br/>

Shall perfect, and for these my death shall pay.<br/>

Accept me; and, in me, from these receive<br/>

The smell of peace toward mankind: let him live<br/>

Before thee reconciled, at least his days<br/>

Numbered, though sad; till death, his doom, (which I<br/>

To mitigate thus plead, not to reverse,)<br/>

To better life shall yield him: where with me<br/>

All my redeemed may dwell in joy and bliss;<br/>

Made one with me, as I with thee am one.<br/>

To whom the Father, without cloud, serene.<br/>

All thy request for Man, accepted Son,<br/>

Obtain; all thy request was my decree:<br/>

But, longer in that Paradise to dwell,<br/>

The law I gave to Nature him forbids:<br/>

Those pure immortal elements, that know,<br/>

No gross, no unharmonious mixture foul,<br/>

Eject him, tainted now; and purge him off,<br/>

As a distemper, gross, to air as gross,<br/>

And mortal food; as may dispose him best<br/>

For dissolution wrought by sin, that first<br/>

Distempered all things, and of incorrupt<br/>

Corrupted.  I, at first, with two fair gifts<br/>

Created him endowed; with happiness,<br/>

And immortality: that fondly lost,<br/>

This other served but to eternize woe;<br/>

Till I provided death: so death becomes<br/>

His final remedy; and, after life,<br/>

Tried in sharp tribulation, and refined<br/>

By faith and faithful works, to second life,<br/>

Waked in the renovation of the just,<br/>

Resigns him up with Heaven and Earth renewed.<br/>

But let us call to synod all the Blest,<br/>

Through Heaven's wide bounds: from them I will not hide<br/>

My judgements; how with mankind I proceed,<br/>

As how with peccant Angels late they saw,<br/>

And in their state, though firm, stood more confirmed.<br/>

He ended, and the Son gave signal high<br/>

To the bright minister that watched; he blew<br/>

His trumpet, heard in Oreb since perhaps<br/>

When God descended, and perhaps once more<br/>

To sound at general doom.  The angelick blast<br/>

Filled all the regions: from their blisful bowers<br/>

Of amarantine shade, fountain or spring,<br/>

By the waters of life, where'er they sat<br/>

In fellowships of joy, the sons of light<br/>

Hasted, resorting to the summons high;<br/>

And took their seats; till from his throne supreme<br/>

The Almighty thus pronounced his sovran will.<br/>

O Sons, like one of us Man is become<br/>

To know both good and evil, since his taste<br/>

Of that defended fruit; but let him boast<br/>

His knowledge of good lost, and evil got;<br/>

Happier! had it sufficed him to have known<br/>

Good by itself, and evil not at all.<br/>

He sorrows now, repents, and prays contrite,<br/>

My motions in him; longer than they move,<br/>

His heart I know, how variable and vain,<br/>

Self-left.  Lest therefore his now bolder hand<br/>

Reach also of the tree of life, and eat,<br/>

And live for ever, dream at least to live<br/>

For ever, to remove him I decree,<br/>

And send him from the garden forth to till<br/>

The ground whence he was taken, fitter soil.<br/>

Michael, this my behest have thou in charge;<br/>

Take to thee from among the Cherubim<br/>

Thy choice of flaming warriours, lest the Fiend,<br/>

Or in behalf of Man, or to invade<br/>

Vacant possession, some new trouble raise:<br/>

Haste thee, and from the Paradise of God<br/>

Without remorse drive out the sinful pair;<br/>

From hallowed ground the unholy; and denounce<br/>

To them, and to their progeny, from thence<br/>

Perpetual banishment.  Yet, lest they faint<br/>

At the sad sentence rigorously urged,<br/>

(For I behold them softened, and with tears<br/>

Bewailing their excess,) all terrour hide.<br/>

If patiently thy bidding they obey,<br/>

Dismiss them not disconsolate; reveal<br/>

To Adam what shall come in future days,<br/>

As I shall thee enlighten; intermix<br/>

My covenant in the Woman's seed renewed;<br/>

So send them forth, though sorrowing, yet in peace:<br/>

And on the east side of the garden place,<br/>

Where entrance up from Eden easiest climbs,<br/>

Cherubick watch; and of a sword the flame<br/>

Wide-waving; all approach far off to fright,<br/>

And guard all passage to the tree of life:<br/>

Lest Paradise a receptacle prove<br/>

To Spirits foul, and all my trees their prey;<br/>

With whose stolen fruit Man once more to delude.<br/>

He ceased; and the arch-angelick Power prepared<br/>

For swift descent; with him the cohort bright<br/>

Of watchful Cherubim: four faces each<br/>

Had, like a double Janus; all their shape<br/>

Spangled with eyes more numerous than those<br/>

Of Argus, and more wakeful than to drouse,<br/>

Charmed with Arcadian pipe, the pastoral reed<br/>

Of Hermes, or his opiate rod.  Mean while,<br/>

To re-salute the world with sacred light,<br/>

Leucothea waked; and with fresh dews imbalmed<br/>

The earth; when Adam and first matron Eve<br/>

Had ended now their orisons, and found<br/>

Strength added from above; new hope to spring<br/>

Out of despair; joy, but with fear yet linked;<br/>

Which thus to Eve his welcome words renewed.<br/>

Eve, easily my faith admit, that all<br/>

The good which we enjoy from Heaven descends;<br/>

But, that from us aught should ascend to Heaven<br/>

So prevalent as to concern the mind<br/>

Of God high-blest, or to incline his will,<br/>

Hard to belief may seem; yet this will prayer<br/>

Or one short sigh of human breath, upborne<br/>

Even to the seat of God.  For since I sought<br/>

By prayer the offended Deity to appease;<br/>

Kneeled, and before him humbled all my heart;<br/>

Methought I saw him placable and mild,<br/>

Bending his ear; persuasion in me grew<br/>

That I was heard with favour; peace returned<br/>

Home to my breast, and to my memory<br/>

His promise, that thy seed shall bruise our foe;<br/>

Which, then not minded in dismay, yet now<br/>

Assures me that the bitterness of death<br/>

Is past, and we shall live.  Whence hail to thee,<br/>

Eve rightly called, mother of all mankind,<br/>

Mother of all things living, since by thee<br/>

Man is to live; and all things live for Man.<br/>

To whom thus Eve with sad demeanour meek.<br/>

Ill-worthy I such title should belong<br/>

To me transgressour; who, for thee ordained<br/>

A help, became thy snare; to me reproach<br/>

Rather belongs, distrust, and all dispraise:<br/>

But infinite in pardon was my Judge,<br/>

That I, who first brought death on all, am graced<br/>

The source of life; next favourable thou,<br/>

Who highly thus to entitle me vouchsaf'st,<br/>

Far other name deserving.  But the field<br/>

To labour calls us, now with sweat imposed,<br/>

Though after sleepless night; for see! the morn,<br/>

All unconcerned with our unrest, begins<br/>

Her rosy progress smiling: let us forth;<br/>

I never from thy side henceforth to stray,<br/>

Where'er our day's work lies, though now enjoined<br/>

Laborious, till day droop; while here we dwell,<br/>

What can be toilsome in these pleasant walks?<br/>

Here let us live, though in fallen state, content.<br/>

So spake, so wished much humbled Eve; but Fate<br/>

Subscribed not:  Nature first gave signs, impressed<br/>

On bird, beast, air; air suddenly eclipsed,<br/>

After short blush of morn; nigh in her sight<br/>

The bird of Jove, stooped from his aery tour,<br/>

Two birds of gayest plume before him drove;<br/>

Down from a hill the beast that reigns in woods,<br/>

First hunter then, pursued a gentle brace,<br/>

Goodliest of all the forest, hart and hind;<br/>

Direct to the eastern gate was bent their flight.<br/>

Adam observed, and with his eye the chase<br/>

Pursuing, not unmoved, to Eve thus spake.<br/>

O Eve, some further change awaits us nigh,<br/>

Which Heaven, by these mute signs in Nature, shows<br/>

Forerunners of his purpose; or to warn<br/>

Us, haply too secure, of our discharge<br/>

From penalty, because from death released<br/>

Some days: how long, and what till then our life,<br/>

Who knows? or more than this, that we are dust,<br/>

And thither must return, and be no more?<br/>

Why else this double object in our sight<br/>

Of flight pursued in the air, and o'er the ground,<br/>

One way the self-same hour? why in the east<br/>

Darkness ere day's mid-course, and morning-light<br/>

More orient in yon western cloud, that draws<br/>

O'er the blue firmament a radiant white,<br/>

And slow descends with something heavenly fraught?<br/>

He erred not; for by this the heavenly bands<br/>

Down from a sky of jasper lighted now<br/>

In Paradise, and on a hill made halt;<br/>

A glorious apparition, had not doubt<br/>

And carnal fear that day dimmed Adam's eye.<br/>

Not that more glorious, when the Angels met<br/>

Jacob in Mahanaim, where he saw<br/>

The field pavilioned with his guardians bright;<br/>

Nor that, which on the flaming mount appeared<br/>

In Dothan, covered with a camp of fire,<br/>

Against the Syrian king, who to surprise<br/>

One man, assassin-like, had levied war,<br/>

War unproclaimed.  The princely Hierarch<br/>

In their bright stand there left his Powers, to seise<br/>

Possession of the garden; he alone,<br/>

To find where Adam sheltered, took his way,<br/>

Not unperceived of Adam; who to Eve,<br/>

While the great visitant approached, thus spake.<br/>

Eve, now expect great tidings, which perhaps<br/>

Of us will soon determine, or impose<br/>

New laws to be observed; for I descry,<br/>

From yonder blazing cloud that veils the hill,<br/>

One of the heavenly host; and, by his gait,<br/>

None of the meanest; some great Potentate<br/>

Or of the Thrones above; such majesty<br/>

Invests him coming! yet not terrible,<br/>

That I should fear; nor sociably mild,<br/>

As Raphael, that I should much confide;<br/>

But solemn and sublime; whom not to offend,<br/>

With reverence I must meet, and thou retire.<br/>

He ended: and the Arch-Angel soon drew nigh,<br/>

Not in his shape celestial, but as man<br/>

Clad to meet man; over his lucid arms<br/>

A military vest of purple flowed,<br/>

Livelier than Meliboean, or the grain<br/>

Of Sarra, worn by kings and heroes old<br/>

In time of truce; Iris had dipt the woof;<br/>

His starry helm unbuckled showed him prime<br/>

In manhood where youth ended; by his side,<br/>

As in a glistering zodiack, hung the sword,<br/>

Satan's dire dread; and in his hand the spear.<br/>

Adam bowed low; he, kingly, from his state<br/>

Inclined not, but his coming thus declared.<br/>

Adam, Heaven's high behest no preface needs:<br/>

Sufficient that thy prayers are heard; and Death,<br/>

Then due by sentence when thou didst transgress,<br/>

Defeated of his seisure many days<br/>

Given thee of grace; wherein thou mayest repent,<br/>

And one bad act with many deeds well done<br/>

Mayest cover:  Well may then thy Lord, appeased,<br/>

Redeem thee quite from Death's rapacious claim;<br/>

But longer in this Paradise to dwell<br/>

Permits not: to remove thee I am come,<br/>

And send thee from the garden forth to till<br/>

The ground whence thou wast taken, fitter soil.<br/>

He added not; for Adam at the news<br/>

Heart-struck with chilling gripe of sorrow stood,<br/>

That all his senses bound; Eve, who unseen<br/>

Yet all had heard, with audible lament<br/>

Discovered soon the place of her retire.<br/>

O unexpected stroke, worse than of Death!<br/>

Must I thus leave thee Paradise? thus leave<br/>

Thee, native soil! these happy walks and shades,<br/>

Fit haunt of Gods? where I had hope to spend,<br/>

Quiet though sad, the respite of that day<br/>

That must be mortal to us both.  O flowers,<br/>

That never will in other climate grow,<br/>

My early visitation, and my last<br/>

At even, which I bred up with tender hand<br/>

From the first opening bud, and gave ye names,<br/>

Who now shall rear ye to the sun, or rank<br/>

Your tribes, and water from the ambrosial fount?<br/>

Thee lastly, nuptial bower! by me adorned<br/>

With what to sight or smell was sweet! from thee<br/>

How shall I part, and whither wander down<br/>

Into a lower world; to this obscure<br/>

And wild, how shall we breathe in other air<br/>

Less pure, accustomed to immortal fruits?<br/>

Whom thus the Angel interrupted mild.<br/>

Lament not, Eve, but patiently resign<br/>

What justly thou hast lost, nor set thy heart,<br/>

Thus over-fond, on that which is not thine:<br/>

Thy going is not lonely; with thee goes<br/>

Thy husband; whom to follow thou art bound;<br/>

Where he abides, think there thy native soil.<br/>

Adam, by this from the cold sudden damp<br/>

Recovering, and his scattered spirits returned,<br/>

To Michael thus his humble words addressed.<br/>

Celestial, whether among the Thrones, or named<br/>

Of them the highest; for such of shape may seem<br/>

Prince above princes! gently hast thou told<br/>

Thy message, which might else in telling wound,<br/>

And in performing end us; what besides<br/>

Of sorrow, and dejection, and despair,<br/>

Our frailty can sustain, thy tidings bring,<br/>

Departure from this happy place, our sweet<br/>

Recess, and only consolation left<br/>

Familiar to our eyes! all places else<br/>

Inhospitable appear, and desolate;<br/>

Nor knowing us, nor known:  And, if by prayer<br/>

Incessant I could hope to change the will<br/>

Of Him who all things can, I would not cease<br/>

To weary him with my assiduous cries:<br/>

But prayer against his absolute decree<br/>

No more avails than breath against the wind,<br/>

Blown stifling back on him that breathes it forth:<br/>

Therefore to his great bidding I submit.<br/>

This most afflicts me, that, departing hence,<br/>

As from his face I shall be hid, deprived<br/>

His blessed countenance:  Here I could frequent<br/>

With worship place by place where he vouchsafed<br/>

Presence Divine; and to my sons relate,<br/>

On this mount he appeared; under this tree<br/>

Stood visible; among these pines his voice<br/>

I heard; here with him at this fountain talked:<br/>

So many grateful altars I would rear<br/>

Of grassy turf, and pile up every stone<br/>

Of lustre from the brook, in memory,<br/>

Or monument to ages; and theron<br/>

Offer sweet-smelling gums, and fruits, and flowers:<br/>

In yonder nether world where shall I seek<br/>

His bright appearances, or foot-step trace?<br/>

For though I fled him angry, yet recalled<br/>

To life prolonged and promised race, I now<br/>

Gladly behold though but his utmost skirts<br/>

Of glory; and far off his steps adore.<br/>

To whom thus Michael with regard benign.<br/>

Adam, thou knowest Heaven his, and all the Earth;<br/>

Not this rock only; his Omnipresence fills<br/>

Land, sea, and air, and every kind that lives,<br/>

Fomented by his virtual power and warmed:<br/>

All the earth he gave thee to possess and rule,<br/>

No despicable gift; surmise not then<br/>

His presence to these narrow bounds confined<br/>

Of Paradise, or Eden: this had been<br/>

Perhaps thy capital seat, from whence had spread<br/>

All generations; and had hither come<br/>

From all the ends of the earth, to celebrate<br/>

And reverence thee, their great progenitor.<br/>

But this pre-eminence thou hast lost, brought down<br/>

To dwell on even ground now with thy sons:<br/>

Yet doubt not but in valley, and in plain,<br/>

God is, as here; and will be found alike<br/>

Present; and of his presence many a sign<br/>

Still following thee, still compassing thee round<br/>

With goodness and paternal love, his face<br/>

Express, and of his steps the track divine.<br/>

Which that thou mayest believe, and be confirmed<br/>

Ere thou from hence depart; know, I am sent<br/>

To show thee what shall come in future days<br/>

To thee, and to thy offspring: good with bad<br/>

Expect to hear; supernal grace contending<br/>

With sinfulness of men; thereby to learn<br/>

True patience, and to temper joy with fear<br/>

And pious sorrow; equally inured<br/>

By moderation either state to bear,<br/>

Prosperous or adverse: so shalt thou lead<br/>

Safest thy life, and best prepared endure<br/>

Thy mortal passage when it comes.—Ascend<br/>

This hill; let Eve (for I have drenched her eyes)<br/>

Here sleep below; while thou to foresight wakest;<br/>

As once thou sleptst, while she to life was formed.<br/>

To whom thus Adam gratefully replied.<br/>

Ascend, I follow thee, safe Guide, the path<br/>

Thou leadest me; and to the hand of Heaven submit,<br/>

However chastening; to the evil turn<br/>

My obvious breast; arming to overcome<br/>

By suffering, and earn rest from labour won,<br/>

If so I may attain.—So both ascend<br/>

In the visions of God.  It was a hill,<br/>

Of Paradise the highest; from whose top<br/>

The hemisphere of earth, in clearest ken,<br/>

Stretched out to the amplest reach of prospect lay.<br/>

Not higher that hill, nor wider looking round,<br/>

Whereon, for different cause, the Tempter set<br/>

Our second Adam, in the wilderness;<br/>

To show him all Earth's kingdoms, and their glory.<br/>

His eye might there command wherever stood<br/>

City of old or modern fame, the seat<br/>

Of mightiest empire, from the destined walls<br/>

Of Cambalu, seat of Cathaian Can,<br/>

And Samarchand by Oxus, Temir's throne,<br/>

To Paquin of Sinaean kings; and thence<br/>

To Agra and Lahor of great Mogul,<br/>

Down to the golden Chersonese; or where<br/>

The Persian in Ecbatan sat, or since<br/>

In Hispahan; or where the Russian Ksar<br/>

In Mosco; or the Sultan in Bizance,<br/>

Turchestan-born; nor could his eye not ken<br/>

The empire of Negus to his utmost port<br/>

Ercoco, and the less maritim kings<br/>

Mombaza, and Quiloa, and Melind,<br/>

And Sofala, thought Ophir, to the realm<br/>

Of Congo, and Angola farthest south;<br/>

Or thence from Niger flood to Atlas mount<br/>

The kingdoms of Almansor, Fez and Sus,<br/>

Morocco, and Algiers, and Tremisen;<br/>

On Europe thence, and where Rome was to sway<br/>

The world: in spirit perhaps he also saw<br/>

Rich Mexico, the seat of Montezume,<br/>

And Cusco in Peru, the richer seat<br/>

Of Atabalipa; and yet unspoiled<br/>

Guiana, whose great city Geryon's sons<br/>

Call El Dorado.  But to nobler sights<br/>

Michael from Adam's eyes the film removed,<br/>

Which that false fruit that promised clearer sight<br/>

Had bred; then purged with euphrasy and rue<br/>

The visual nerve, for he had much to see;<br/>

And from the well of life three drops instilled.<br/>

So deep the power of these ingredients pierced,<br/>

Even to the inmost seat of mental sight,<br/>

That Adam, now enforced to close his eyes,<br/>

Sunk down, and all his spirits became entranced;<br/>

But him the gentle Angel by the hand<br/>

Soon raised, and his attention thus recalled.<br/>

Adam, now ope thine eyes; and first behold<br/>

The effects, which thy original crime hath wrought<br/>

In some to spring from thee; who never touched<br/>

The excepted tree; nor with the snake conspired;<br/>

Nor sinned thy sin; yet from that sin derive<br/>

Corruption, to bring forth more violent deeds.<br/>

His eyes he opened, and beheld a field,<br/>

Part arable and tilth, whereon were sheaves<br/>

New reaped; the other part sheep-walks and folds;<br/>

I' the midst an altar as the land-mark stood,<br/>

Rustick, of grassy sord; thither anon<br/>

A sweaty reaper from his tillage brought<br/>

First fruits, the green ear, and the yellow sheaf,<br/>

Unculled, as came to hand; a shepherd next,<br/>

More meek, came with the firstlings of his flock,<br/>

Choicest and best; then, sacrificing, laid<br/>

The inwards and their fat, with incense strowed,<br/>

On the cleft wood, and all due rights performed:<br/>

His offering soon propitious fire from Heaven<br/>

Consumed with nimble glance, and grateful steam;<br/>

The other's not, for his was not sincere;<br/>

Whereat he inly raged, and, as they talked,<br/>

Smote him into the midriff with a stone<br/>

That beat out life; he fell; and, deadly pale,<br/>

Groaned out his soul with gushing blood effused.<br/>

Much at that sight was Adam in his heart<br/>

Dismayed, and thus in haste to the Angel cried.<br/>

O Teacher, some great mischief hath befallen<br/>

To that meek man, who well had sacrificed;<br/>

Is piety thus and pure devotion paid?<br/>

To whom Michael thus, he also moved, replied.<br/>

These two are brethren, Adam, and to come<br/>

Out of thy loins; the unjust the just hath slain,<br/>

For envy that his brother's offering found<br/>

From Heaven acceptance; but the bloody fact<br/>

Will be avenged; and the other's faith, approved,<br/>

Lose no reward; though here thou see him die,<br/>

Rolling in dust and gore.  To which our sire.<br/>

Alas! both for the deed, and for the cause!<br/>

But have I now seen Death?  Is this the way<br/>

I must return to native dust?  O sight<br/>

Of terrour, foul and ugly to behold,<br/>

Horrid to think, how horrible to feel!<br/>

To whom thus Michael.  Death thou hast seen<br/>

In his first shape on Man; but many shapes<br/>

Of Death, and many are the ways that lead<br/>

To his grim cave, all dismal; yet to sense<br/>

More terrible at the entrance, than within.<br/>

Some, as thou sawest, by violent stroke shall die;<br/>

By fire, flood, famine, by intemperance more<br/>

In meats and drinks, which on the earth shall bring<br/>

Diseases dire, of which a monstrous crew<br/>

Before thee shall appear; that thou mayest know<br/>

What misery the inabstinence of Eve<br/>

Shall bring on Men.  Immediately a place<br/>

Before his eyes appeared, sad, noisome, dark;<br/>

A lazar-house it seemed; wherein were laid<br/>

Numbers of all diseased; all maladies<br/>

Of ghastly spasm, or racking torture, qualms<br/>

Of heart-sick agony, all feverous kinds,<br/>

Convulsions, epilepsies, fierce catarrhs,<br/>

Intestine stone and ulcer, colick-pangs,<br/>

Demoniack phrenzy, moaping melancholy,<br/>

And moon-struck madness, pining atrophy,<br/>

Marasmus, and wide-wasting pestilence,<br/>

Dropsies, and asthmas, and joint-racking rheums.<br/>

Dire was the tossing, deep the groans; Despair<br/>

Tended the sick busiest from couch to couch;<br/>

And over them triumphant Death his dart<br/>

Shook, but delayed to strike, though oft invoked<br/>

With vows, as their chief good, and final hope.<br/>

Sight so deform what heart of rock could long<br/>

Dry-eyed behold?  Adam could not, but wept,<br/>

Though not of woman born; compassion quelled<br/>

His best of man, and gave him up to tears<br/>

A space, till firmer thoughts restrained excess;<br/>

And, scarce recovering words, his plaint renewed.<br/>

O miserable mankind, to what fall<br/>

Degraded, to what wretched state reserved!<br/>

Better end here unborn.  Why is life given<br/>

To be thus wrested from us? rather, why<br/>

Obtruded on us thus? who, if we knew<br/>

What we receive, would either no accept<br/>

Life offered, or soon beg to lay it down;<br/>

Glad to be so dismissed in peace.  Can thus<br/>

The image of God in Man, created once<br/>

So goodly and erect, though faulty since,<br/>

To such unsightly sufferings be debased<br/>

Under inhuman pains?  Why should not Man,<br/>

Retaining still divine similitude<br/>

In part, from such deformities be free,<br/>

And, for his Maker's image sake, exempt?<br/>

Their Maker's image, answered Michael, then<br/>

Forsook them, when themselves they vilified<br/>

To serve ungoverned Appetite; and took<br/>

His image whom they served, a brutish vice,<br/>

Inductive mainly to the sin of Eve.<br/>

Therefore so abject is their punishment,<br/>

Disfiguring not God's likeness, but their own;<br/>

Or if his likeness, by themselves defaced;<br/>

While they pervert pure Nature's healthful rules<br/>

To loathsome sickness; worthily, since they<br/>

God's image did not reverence in themselves.<br/>

I yield it just, said Adam, and submit.<br/>

But is there yet no other way, besides<br/>

These painful passages, how we may come<br/>

To death, and mix with our connatural dust?<br/>

There is, said Michael, if thou well observe<br/>

The rule of Not too much; by temperance taught,<br/>

In what thou eatest and drinkest; seeking from thence<br/>

Due nourishment, not gluttonous delight,<br/>

Till many years over thy head return:<br/>

So mayest thou live; till, like ripe fruit, thou drop<br/>

Into thy mother's lap; or be with ease<br/>

Gathered, nor harshly plucked; for death mature:<br/>

This is Old Age; but then, thou must outlive<br/>

Thy youth, thy strength, thy beauty; which will change<br/>

To withered, weak, and gray; thy senses then,<br/>

Obtuse, all taste of pleasure must forego,<br/>

To what thou hast; and, for the air of youth,<br/>

Hopeful and cheerful, in thy blood will reign<br/>

A melancholy damp of cold and dry<br/>

To weigh thy spirits down, and last consume<br/>

The balm of life.  To whom our ancestor.<br/>

Henceforth I fly not death, nor would prolong<br/>

Life much; bent rather, how I may be quit,<br/>

Fairest and easiest, of this cumbrous charge;<br/>

Which I must keep till my appointed day<br/>

Of rendering up, and patiently attend<br/>

My dissolution.  Michael replied.<br/>

Nor love thy life, nor hate; but what thou livest<br/>

Live well; how long, or short, permit to Heaven:<br/>

And now prepare thee for another sight.<br/>

He looked, and saw a spacious plain, whereon<br/>

Were tents of various hue; by some, were herds<br/>

Of cattle grazing; others, whence the sound<br/>

Of instruments, that made melodious chime,<br/>

Was heard, of harp and organ; and, who moved<br/>

Their stops and chords, was seen; his volant touch,<br/>

Instinct through all proportions, low and high,<br/>

Fled and pursued transverse the resonant fugue.<br/>

In other part stood one who, at the forge<br/>

Labouring, two massy clods of iron and brass<br/>

Had melted, (whether found where casual fire<br/>

Had wasted woods on mountain or in vale,<br/>

Down to the veins of earth; thence gliding hot<br/>

To some cave's mouth; or whether washed by stream<br/>

From underground;) the liquid ore he drained<br/>

Into fit moulds prepared; from which he formed<br/>

First his own tools; then, what might else be wrought<br/>

Fusil or graven in metal.  After these,<br/>

But on the hither side, a different sort<br/>

From the high neighbouring hills, which was their seat,<br/>

Down to the plain descended; by their guise<br/>

Just men they seemed, and all their study bent<br/>

To worship God aright, and know his works<br/>

Not hid; nor those things last, which might preserve<br/>

Freedom and peace to Men; they on the plain<br/>

Long had not walked, when from the tents, behold!<br/>

A bevy of fair women, richly gay<br/>

In gems and wanton dress; to the harp they sung<br/>

Soft amorous ditties, and in dance came on:<br/>

The men, though grave, eyed them; and let their eyes<br/>

Rove without rein; till, in the amorous net<br/>

Fast caught, they liked; and each his liking chose;<br/>

And now of love they treat, till the evening-star,<br/>

Love's harbinger, appeared; then, all in heat<br/>

They light the nuptial torch, and bid invoke<br/>

Hymen, then first to marriage rites invoked:<br/>

With feast and musick all the tents resound.<br/>

Such happy interview, and fair event<br/>

Of love and youth not lost, songs, garlands, flowers,<br/>

And charming symphonies, attached the heart<br/>

Of Adam, soon inclined to admit delight,<br/>

The bent of nature; which he thus expressed.<br/>

True opener of mine eyes, prime Angel blest;<br/>

Much better seems this vision, and more hope<br/>

Of peaceful days portends, than those two past;<br/>

Those were of hate and death, or pain much worse;<br/>

Here Nature seems fulfilled in all her ends.<br/>

To whom thus Michael.  Judge not what is best<br/>

By pleasure, though to nature seeming meet;<br/>

Created, as thou art, to nobler end<br/>

Holy and pure, conformity divine.<br/>

Those tents thou sawest so pleasant, were the tents<br/>

Of wickedness, wherein shall dwell his race<br/>

Who slew his brother; studious they appear<br/>

Of arts that polish life, inventers rare;<br/>

Unmindful of their Maker, though his Spirit<br/>

Taught them; but they his gifts acknowledged none.<br/>

Yet they a beauteous offspring shall beget;<br/>

For that fair female troop thou sawest, that seemed<br/>

Of Goddesses, so blithe, so smooth, so gay,<br/>

Yet empty of all good wherein consists<br/>

Woman's domestick honour and chief praise;<br/>

Bred only and completed to the taste<br/>

Of lustful appetence, to sing, to dance,<br/>

To dress, and troll the tongue, and roll the eye:<br/>

To these that sober race of men, whose lives<br/>

Religious titled them the sons of God,<br/>

Shall yield up all their virtue, all their fame<br/>

Ignobly, to the trains and to the smiles<br/>

Of these fair atheists; and now swim in joy,<br/>

Erelong to swim at large; and laugh, for which<br/>

The world erelong a world of tears must weep.<br/>

To whom thus Adam, of short joy bereft.<br/>

O pity and shame, that they, who to live well<br/>

Entered so fair, should turn aside to tread<br/>

Paths indirect, or in the mid way faint!<br/>

But still I see the tenour of Man's woe<br/>

Holds on the same, from Woman to begin.<br/>

From Man's effeminate slackness it begins,<br/>

Said the Angel, who should better hold his place<br/>

By wisdom, and superiour gifts received.<br/>

But now prepare thee for another scene.<br/>

He looked, and saw wide territory spread<br/>

Before him, towns, and rural works between;<br/>

Cities of men with lofty gates and towers,<br/>

Concourse in arms, fierce faces threatening war,<br/>

Giants of mighty bone and bold emprise;<br/>

Part wield their arms, part curb the foaming steed,<br/>

Single or in array of battle ranged<br/>

Both horse and foot, nor idly mustering stood;<br/>

One way a band select from forage drives<br/>

A herd of beeves, fair oxen and fair kine,<br/>

From a fat meadow ground; or fleecy flock,<br/>

Ewes and their bleating lambs over the plain,<br/>

Their booty; scarce with life the shepherds fly,<br/>

But call in aid, which makes a bloody fray;<br/>

With cruel tournament the squadrons join;<br/>

Where cattle pastured late, now scattered lies<br/>

With carcasses and arms the ensanguined field,<br/>

Deserted:  Others to a city strong<br/>

Lay siege, encamped; by battery, scale, and mine,<br/>

Assaulting; others from the wall defend<br/>

With dart and javelin, stones, and sulphurous fire;<br/>

On each hand slaughter, and gigantick deeds.<br/>

In other part the sceptered heralds call<br/>

To council, in the city-gates; anon<br/>

Gray-headed men and grave, with warriours mixed,<br/>

Assemble, and harangues are heard; but soon,<br/>

In factious opposition; till at last,<br/>

Of middle age one rising, eminent<br/>

In wise deport, spake much of right and wrong,<br/>

Of justice, or religion, truth, and peace,<br/>

And judgement from above: him old and young<br/>

Exploded, and had seized with violent hands,<br/>

Had not a cloud descending snatched him thence<br/>

Unseen amid the throng: so violence<br/>

Proceeded, and oppression, and sword-law,<br/>

Through all the plain, and refuge none was found.<br/>

Adam was all in tears, and to his guide<br/>

Lamenting turned full sad; O! what are these,<br/>

Death's ministers, not men? who thus deal death<br/>

Inhumanly to men, and multiply<br/>

Ten thousandfold the sin of him who slew<br/>

His brother: for of whom such massacre<br/>

Make they, but of their brethren; men of men<br/>

But who was that just man, whom had not Heaven<br/>

Rescued, had in his righteousness been lost?<br/>

To whom thus Michael.  These are the product<br/>

Of those ill-mated marriages thou sawest;<br/>

Where good with bad were matched, who of themselves<br/>

Abhor to join; and, by imprudence mixed,<br/>

Produce prodigious births of body or mind.<br/>

Such were these giants, men of high renown;<br/>

For in those days might only shall be admired,<br/>

And valour and heroick virtue called;<br/>

To overcome in battle, and subdue<br/>

Nations, and bring home spoils with infinite<br/>

Man-slaughter, shall be held the highest pitch<br/>

Of human glory; and for glory done<br/>

Of triumph, to be styled great conquerours<br/>

Patrons of mankind, Gods, and sons of Gods;<br/>

Destroyers rightlier called, and plagues of men.<br/>

Thus fame shall be achieved, renown on earth;<br/>

And what most merits fame, in silence hid.<br/>

But he, the seventh from thee, whom thou beheldst<br/>

The only righteous in a world preverse,<br/>

And therefore hated, therefore so beset<br/>

With foes, for daring single to be just,<br/>

And utter odious truth, that God would come<br/>

To judge them with his Saints; him the Most High<br/>

Rapt in a balmy cloud with winged steeds<br/>

Did, as thou sawest, receive, to walk with God<br/>

High in salvation and the climes of bliss,<br/>

Exempt from death; to show thee what reward<br/>

Awaits the good; the rest what punishment;<br/>

Which now direct thine eyes and soon behold.<br/>

He looked, and saw the face of things quite changed;<br/>

The brazen throat of war had ceased to roar;<br/>

All now was turned to jollity and game,<br/>

To luxury and riot, feast and dance;<br/>

Marrying or prostituting, as befel,<br/>

Rape or adultery, where passing fair<br/>

Allured them; thence from cups to civil broils.<br/>

At length a reverend sire among them came,<br/>

And of their doings great dislike declared,<br/>

And testified against their ways; he oft<br/>

Frequented their assemblies, whereso met,<br/>

Triumphs or festivals; and to them preached<br/>

Conversion and repentance, as to souls<br/>

In prison, under judgements imminent:<br/>

But all in vain: which when he saw, he ceased<br/>

Contending, and removed his tents far off;<br/>

Then, from the mountain hewing timber tall,<br/>

Began to build a vessel of huge bulk;<br/>

Measured by cubit, length, and breadth, and highth;<br/>

Smeared round with pitch; and in the side a door<br/>

Contrived; and of provisions laid in large,<br/>

For man and beast: when lo, a wonder strange!<br/>

Of every beast, and bird, and insect small,<br/>

Came sevens, and pairs; and entered in as taught<br/>

Their order: last the sire and his three sons,<br/>

With their four wives; and God made fast the door.<br/>

Mean while the south-wind rose, and, with black wings<br/>

Wide-hovering, all the clouds together drove<br/>

From under Heaven; the hills to their supply<br/>

Vapour, and exhalation dusk and moist,<br/>

Sent up amain; and now the thickened sky<br/>

Like a dark ceiling stood; down rushed the rain<br/>

Impetuous; and continued, till the earth<br/>

No more was seen: the floating vessel swum<br/>

Uplifted, and secure with beaked prow<br/>

Rode tilting o'er the waves; all dwellings else<br/>

Flood overwhelmed, and them with all their pomp<br/>

Deep under water rolled; sea covered sea,<br/>

Sea without shore; and in their palaces,<br/>

Where luxury late reigned, sea-monsters whelped<br/>

And stabled; of mankind, so numerous late,<br/>

All left, in one small bottom swum imbarked.<br/>

How didst thou grieve then, Adam, to behold<br/>

The end of all thy offspring, end so sad,<br/>

Depopulation!  Thee another flood,<br/>

Of tears and sorrow a flood, thee also drowned,<br/>

And sunk thee as thy sons; till, gently reared<br/>

By the Angel, on thy feet thou stoodest at last,<br/>

Though comfortless; as when a father mourns<br/>

His children, all in view destroyed at once;<br/>

And scarce to the Angel utter'dst thus thy plaint.<br/>

O visions ill foreseen!  Better had I<br/>

Lived ignorant of future! so had borne<br/>

My part of evil only, each day's lot<br/>

Enough to bear; those now, that were dispensed<br/>

The burden of many ages, on me light<br/>

At once, by my foreknowledge gaining birth<br/>

Abortive, to torment me ere their being,<br/>

With thought that they must be.  Let no man seek<br/>

Henceforth to be foretold, what shall befall<br/>

Him or his children; evil he may be sure,<br/>

Which neither his foreknowing can prevent;<br/>

And he the future evil shall no less<br/>

In apprehension than in substance feel,<br/>

Grievous to bear: but that care now is past,<br/>

Man is not whom to warn: those few escaped<br/>

Famine and anguish will at last consume,<br/>

Wandering that watery desart:  I had hope,<br/>

When violence was ceased, and war on earth,<br/>

All would have then gone well; peace would have crowned<br/>

With length of happy days the race of Man;<br/>

But I was far deceived; for now I see<br/>

Peace to corrupt no less than war to waste.<br/>

How comes it thus? unfold, celestial Guide,<br/>

And whether here the race of Man will end.<br/>

To whom thus Michael.  Those, whom last thou sawest<br/>

In triumph and luxurious wealth, are they<br/>

First seen in acts of prowess eminent<br/>

And great exploits, but of true virtue void;<br/>

Who, having spilt much blood, and done much wast<br/>

Subduing nations, and achieved thereby<br/>

Fame in the world, high titles, and rich prey;<br/>

Shall change their course to pleasure, ease, and sloth,<br/>

Surfeit, and lust; till wantonness and pride<br/>

Raise out of friendship hostile deeds in peace.<br/>

The conquered also, and enslaved by war,<br/>

Shall, with their freedom lost, all virtue lose<br/>

And fear of God; from whom their piety feigned<br/>

In sharp contest of battle found no aid<br/>

Against invaders; therefore, cooled in zeal,<br/>

Thenceforth shall practice how to live secure,<br/>

Worldly or dissolute, on what their lords<br/>

Shall leave them to enjoy; for the earth shall bear<br/>

More than enough, that temperance may be tried:<br/>

So all shall turn degenerate, all depraved;<br/>

Justice and temperance, truth and faith, forgot;<br/>

One man except, the only son of light<br/>

In a dark age, against example good,<br/>

Against allurement, custom, and a world<br/>

Offended: fearless of reproach and scorn,<br/>

Or violence, he of their wicked ways<br/>

Shall them admonish; and before them set<br/>

The paths of righteousness, how much more safe<br/>

And full of peace; denouncing wrath to come<br/>

On their impenitence; and shall return<br/>

Of them derided, but of God observed<br/>

The one just man alive; by his command<br/>

Shall build a wonderous ark, as thou beheldst,<br/>

To save himself, and houshold, from amidst<br/>

A world devote to universal wrack.<br/>

No sooner he, with them of man and beast<br/>

Select for life, shall in the ark be lodged,<br/>

And sheltered round; but all the cataracts<br/>

Of Heaven set open on the Earth shall pour<br/>

Rain, day and night; all fountains of the deep,<br/>

Broke up, shall heave the ocean to usurp<br/>

Beyond all bounds; till inundation rise<br/>

Above the highest hills:  Then shall this mount<br/>

Of Paradise by might of waves be moved<br/>

Out of his place, pushed by the horned flood,<br/>

With all his verdure spoiled, and trees adrift,<br/>

Down the great river to the opening gulf,<br/>

And there take root an island salt and bare,<br/>

The haunt of seals, and orcs, and sea-mews' clang:<br/>

To teach thee that God attributes to place<br/>

No sanctity, if none be thither brought<br/>

By men who there frequent, or therein dwell.<br/>

And now, what further shall ensue, behold.<br/>

He looked, and saw the ark hull on the flood,<br/>

Which now abated; for the clouds were fled,<br/>

Driven by a keen north-wind, that, blowing dry,<br/>

Wrinkled the face of deluge, as decayed;<br/>

And the clear sun on his wide watery glass<br/>

Gazed hot, and of the fresh wave largely drew,<br/>

As after thirst; which made their flowing shrink<br/>

From standing lake to tripping ebb, that stole<br/>

With soft foot towards the deep; who now had stopt<br/>

His sluces, as the Heaven his windows shut.<br/>

The ark no more now floats, but seems on ground,<br/>

Fast on the top of some high mountain fixed.<br/>

And now the tops of hills, as rocks, appear;<br/>

With clamour thence the rapid currents drive,<br/>

Towards the retreating sea, their furious tide.<br/>

Forthwith from out the ark a raven flies,<br/>

And after him, the surer messenger,<br/>

A dove sent forth once and again to spy<br/>

Green tree or ground, whereon his foot may light:<br/>

The second time returning, in his bill<br/>

An olive-leaf he brings, pacifick sign:<br/>

Anon dry ground appears, and from his ark<br/>

The ancient sire descends, with all his train;<br/>

Then with uplifted hands, and eyes devout,<br/>

Grateful to Heaven, over his head beholds<br/>

A dewy cloud, and in the cloud a bow<br/>

Conspicuous with three lifted colours gay,<br/>

Betokening peace from God, and covenant new.<br/>

Whereat the heart of Adam, erst so sad,<br/>

Greatly rejoiced; and thus his joy broke forth.<br/>

O thou, who future things canst represent<br/>

As present, heavenly Instructer!  I revive<br/>

At this last sight; assured that Man shall live,<br/>

With all the creatures, and their seed preserve.<br/>

Far less I now lament for one whole world<br/>

Of wicked sons destroyed, than I rejoice<br/>

For one man found so perfect, and so just,<br/>

That God vouchsafes to raise another world<br/>

From him, and all his anger to forget.<br/>

But say, what mean those coloured streaks in Heaven<br/>

Distended, as the brow of God appeased?<br/>

Or serve they, as a flowery verge, to bind<br/>

The fluid skirts of that same watery cloud,<br/>

Lest it again dissolve, and shower the earth?<br/>

To whom the Arch-Angel.  Dextrously thou aimest;<br/>

So willingly doth God remit his ire,<br/>

Though late repenting him of Man depraved;<br/>

Grieved at his heart, when looking down he saw<br/>

The whole earth filled with violence, and all flesh<br/>

Corrupting each their way; yet, those removed,<br/>

Such grace shall one just man find in his sight,<br/>

That he relents, not to blot out mankind;<br/>

And makes a covenant never to destroy<br/>

The earth again by flood; nor let the sea<br/>

Surpass his bounds; nor rain to drown the world,<br/>

With man therein or beast; but, when he brings<br/>

Over the earth a cloud, will therein set<br/>

His triple-coloured bow, whereon to look,<br/>

And call to mind his covenant: Day and night,<br/>

Seed-time and harvest, heat and hoary frost,<br/>

Shall hold their course; till fire purge all things new,<br/>

Both Heaven and Earth, wherein the just shall dwell.<br/>
</p>
<h3 id="id00038" style="margin-top: 3em">Book XII</h3>
<p id="id00039" style="margin-top: 2em">As one who in his journey bates at noon,<br/>

Though bent on speed; so here the Arch-Angel paused<br/>

Betwixt the world destroyed and world restored,<br/>

If Adam aught perhaps might interpose;<br/>

Then, with transition sweet, new speech resumes.<br/>

Thus thou hast seen one world begin, and end;<br/>

And Man, as from a second stock, proceed.<br/>

Much thou hast yet to see; but I perceive<br/>

Thy mortal sight to fail; objects divine<br/>

Must needs impair and weary human sense:<br/>

Henceforth what is to come I will relate;<br/>

Thou therefore give due audience, and attend.<br/>

This second source of Men, while yet but few,<br/>

And while the dread of judgement past remains<br/>

Fresh in their minds, fearing the Deity,<br/>

With some regard to what is just and right<br/>

Shall lead their lives, and multiply apace;<br/>

Labouring the soil, and reaping plenteous crop,<br/>

Corn, wine, and oil; and, from the herd or flock,<br/>

Oft sacrificing bullock, lamb, or kid,<br/>

With large wine-offerings poured, and sacred feast,<br/>

Shall spend their days in joy unblamed; and dwell<br/>

Long time in peace, by families and tribes,<br/>

Under paternal rule: till one shall rise<br/>

Of proud ambitious heart; who, not content<br/>

With fair equality, fraternal state,<br/>

Will arrogate dominion undeserved<br/>

Over his brethren, and quite dispossess<br/>

Concord and law of nature from the earth;<br/>

Hunting (and men not beasts shall be his game)<br/>

With war, and hostile snare, such as refuse<br/>

Subjection to his empire tyrannous:<br/>

A mighty hunter thence he shall be styled<br/>

Before the Lord; as in despite of Heaven,<br/>

Or from Heaven, claiming second sovranty;<br/>

And from rebellion shall derive his name,<br/>

Though of rebellion others he accuse.<br/>

He with a crew, whom like ambition joins<br/>

With him or under him to tyrannize,<br/>

Marching from Eden towards the west, shall find<br/>

The plain, wherein a black bituminous gurge<br/>

Boils out from under ground, the mouth of Hell:<br/>

Of brick, and of that stuff, they cast to build<br/>

A city and tower, whose top may reach to Heaven;<br/>

And get themselves a name; lest, far dispersed<br/>

In foreign lands, their memory be lost;<br/>

Regardless whether good or evil fame.<br/>

But God, who oft descends to visit men<br/>

Unseen, and through their habitations walks<br/>

To mark their doings, them beholding soon,<br/>

Comes down to see their city, ere the tower<br/>

Obstruct Heaven-towers, and in derision sets<br/>

Upon their tongues a various spirit, to rase<br/>

Quite out their native language; and, instead,<br/>

To sow a jangling noise of words unknown:<br/>

Forthwith a hideous gabble rises loud,<br/>

Among the builders; each to other calls<br/>

Not understood; till hoarse, and all in rage,<br/>

As mocked they storm: great laughter was in Heaven,<br/>

And looking down, to see the hubbub strange,<br/>

And hear the din:  Thus was the building left<br/>

Ridiculous, and the work Confusion named.<br/>

Whereto thus Adam, fatherly displeased.<br/>

O execrable son! so to aspire<br/>

Above his brethren; to himself assuming<br/>

Authority usurped, from God not given:<br/>

He gave us only over beast, fish, fowl,<br/>

Dominion absolute; that right we hold<br/>

By his donation; but man over men<br/>

He made not lord; such title to himself<br/>

Reserving, human left from human free.<br/>

But this usurper his encroachment proud<br/>

Stays not on Man; to God his tower intends<br/>

Siege and defiance:  Wretched man! what food<br/>

Will he convey up thither, to sustain<br/>

Himself and his rash army; where thin air<br/>

Above the clouds will pine his entrails gross,<br/>

And famish him of breath, if not of bread?<br/>

To whom thus Michael.  Justly thou abhorrest<br/>

That son, who on the quiet state of men<br/>

Such trouble brought, affecting to subdue<br/>

Rational liberty; yet know withal,<br/>

Since thy original lapse, true liberty<br/>

Is lost, which always with right reason dwells<br/>

Twinned, and from her hath no dividual being:<br/>

Reason in man obscured, or not obeyed,<br/>

Immediately inordinate desires,<br/>

And upstart passions, catch the government<br/>

From reason; and to servitude reduce<br/>

Man, till then free.  Therefore, since he permits<br/>

Within himself unworthy powers to reign<br/>

Over free reason, God, in judgement just,<br/>

Subjects him from without to violent lords;<br/>

Who oft as undeservedly enthrall<br/>

His outward freedom:  Tyranny must be;<br/>

Though to the tyrant thereby no excuse.<br/>

Yet sometimes nations will decline so low<br/>

From virtue, which is reason, that no wrong,<br/>

But justice, and some fatal curse annexed,<br/>

Deprives them of their outward liberty;<br/>

Their inward lost:  Witness the irreverent son<br/>

Of him who built the ark; who, for the shame<br/>

Done to his father, heard this heavy curse,<br/>

Servant of servants, on his vicious race.<br/>

Thus will this latter, as the former world,<br/>

Still tend from bad to worse; till God at last,<br/>

Wearied with their iniquities, withdraw<br/>

His presence from among them, and avert<br/>

His holy eyes; resolving from thenceforth<br/>

To leave them to their own polluted ways;<br/>

And one peculiar nation to select<br/>

From all the rest, of whom to be invoked,<br/>

A nation from one faithful man to spring:<br/>

Him on this side Euphrates yet residing,<br/>

Bred up in idol-worship:  O, that men<br/>

(Canst thou believe?) should be so stupid grown,<br/>

While yet the patriarch lived, who 'scaped the flood,<br/>

As to forsake the living God, and fall<br/>

To worship their own work in wood and stone<br/>

For Gods!  Yet him God the Most High vouchsafes<br/>

To call by vision, from his father's house,<br/>

His kindred, and false Gods, into a land<br/>

Which he will show him; and from him will raise<br/>

A mighty nation; and upon him shower<br/>

His benediction so, that in his seed<br/>

All nations shall be blest: he straight obeys;<br/>

Not knowing to what land, yet firm believes:<br/>

I see him, but thou canst not, with what faith<br/>

He leaves his Gods, his friends, and native soil,<br/>

Ur of Chaldaea, passing now the ford<br/>

To Haran; after him a cumbrous train<br/>

Of herds and flocks, and numerous servitude;<br/>

Not wandering poor, but trusting all his wealth<br/>

With God, who called him, in a land unknown.<br/>

Canaan he now attains; I see his tents<br/>

Pitched about Sechem, and the neighbouring plain<br/>

Of Moreh; there by promise he receives<br/>

Gift to his progeny of all that land,<br/>

From Hameth northward to the Desart south;<br/>

(Things by their names I call, though yet unnamed;)<br/>

From Hermon east to the great western Sea;<br/>

Mount Hermon, yonder sea; each place behold<br/>

In prospect, as I point them; on the shore<br/>

Mount Carmel; here, the double-founted stream,<br/>

Jordan, true limit eastward; but his sons<br/>

Shall dwell to Senir, that long ridge of hills.<br/>

This ponder, that all nations of the earth<br/>

Shall in his seed be blessed:  By that seed<br/>

Is meant thy great Deliverer, who shall bruise<br/>

The Serpent's head; whereof to thee anon<br/>

Plainlier shall be revealed.  This patriarch blest,<br/>

Whom faithful Abraham due time shall call,<br/>

A son, and of his son a grand-child, leaves;<br/>

Like him in faith, in wisdom, and renown:<br/>

The grandchild, with twelve sons increased, departs<br/>

From Canaan to a land hereafter called<br/>

Egypt, divided by the river Nile<br/>

See where it flows, disgorging at seven mouths<br/>

Into the sea.  To sojourn in that land<br/>

He comes, invited by a younger son<br/>

In time of dearth, a son whose worthy deeds<br/>

Raise him to be the second in that realm<br/>

Of Pharaoh.  There he dies, and leaves his race<br/>

Growing into a nation, and now grown<br/>

Suspected to a sequent king, who seeks<br/>

To stop their overgrowth, as inmate guests<br/>

Too numerous; whence of guests he makes them slaves<br/>

Inhospitably, and kills their infant males:<br/>

Till by two brethren (these two brethren call<br/>

Moses and Aaron) sent from God to claim<br/>

His people from enthralment, they return,<br/>

With glory and spoil, back to their promised land.<br/>

But first, the lawless tyrant, who denies<br/>

To know their God, or message to regard,<br/>

Must be compelled by signs and judgements dire;<br/>

To blood unshed the rivers must be turned;<br/>

Frogs, lice, and flies, must all his palace fill<br/>

With loathed intrusion, and fill all the land;<br/>

His cattle must of rot and murren die;<br/>

Botches and blains must all his flesh emboss,<br/>

And all his people; thunder mixed with hail,<br/>

Hail mixed with fire, must rend the Egyptians sky,<br/>

And wheel on the earth, devouring where it rolls;<br/>

What it devours not, herb, or fruit, or grain,<br/>

A darksome cloud of locusts swarming down<br/>

Must eat, and on the ground leave nothing green;<br/>

Darkness must overshadow all his bounds,<br/>

Palpable darkness, and blot out three days;<br/>

Last, with one midnight stroke, all the first-born<br/>

Of Egypt must lie dead.  Thus with ten wounds<br/>

The river-dragon tamed at length submits<br/>

To let his sojourners depart, and oft<br/>

Humbles his stubborn heart; but still, as ice<br/>

More hardened after thaw; till, in his rage<br/>

Pursuing whom he late dismissed, the sea<br/>

Swallows him with his host; but them lets pass,<br/>

As on dry land, between two crystal walls;<br/>

Awed by the rod of Moses so to stand<br/>

Divided, till his rescued gain their shore:<br/>

Such wondrous power God to his saint will lend,<br/>

Though present in his Angel; who shall go<br/>

Before them in a cloud, and pillar of fire;<br/>

By day a cloud, by night a pillar of fire;<br/>

To guide them in their journey, and remove<br/>

Behind them, while the obdurate king pursues:<br/>

All night he will pursue; but his approach<br/>

Darkness defends between till morning watch;<br/>

Then through the fiery pillar, and the cloud,<br/>

God looking forth will trouble all his host,<br/>

And craze their chariot-wheels: when by command<br/>

Moses once more his potent rod extends<br/>

Over the sea; the sea his rod obeys;<br/>

On their embattled ranks the waves return,<br/>

And overwhelm their war:  The race elect<br/>

Safe toward Canaan from the shore advance<br/>

Through the wild Desart, not the readiest way;<br/>

Lest, entering on the Canaanite alarmed,<br/>

War terrify them inexpert, and fear<br/>

Return them back to Egypt, choosing rather<br/>

Inglorious life with servitude; for life<br/>

To noble and ignoble is more sweet<br/>

Untrained in arms, where rashness leads not on.<br/>

This also shall they gain by their delay<br/>

In the wide wilderness; there they shall found<br/>

Their government, and their great senate choose<br/>

Through the twelve tribes, to rule by laws ordained:<br/>

God from the mount of Sinai, whose gray top<br/>

Shall tremble, he descending, will himself<br/>

In thunder, lightning, and loud trumpets' sound,<br/>

Ordain them laws; part, such as appertain<br/>

To civil justice; part, religious rites<br/>

Of sacrifice; informing them, by types<br/>

And shadows, of that destined Seed to bruise<br/>

The Serpent, by what means he shall achieve<br/>

Mankind's deliverance.  But the voice of God<br/>

To mortal ear is dreadful:  They beseech<br/>

That Moses might report to them his will,<br/>

And terrour cease; he grants what they besought,<br/>

Instructed that to God is no access<br/>

Without Mediator, whose high office now<br/>

Moses in figure bears; to introduce<br/>

One greater, of whose day he shall foretel,<br/>

And all the Prophets in their age the times<br/>

Of great Messiah shall sing.  Thus, laws and rites<br/>

Established, such delight hath God in Men<br/>

Obedient to his will, that he vouchsafes<br/>

Among them to set up his tabernacle;<br/>

The Holy One with mortal Men to dwell:<br/>

By his prescript a sanctuary is framed<br/>

Of cedar, overlaid with gold; therein<br/>

An ark, and in the ark his testimony,<br/>

The records of his covenant; over these<br/>

A mercy-seat of gold, between the wings<br/>

Of two bright Cherubim; before him burn<br/>

Seven lamps as in a zodiack representing<br/>

The heavenly fires; over the tent a cloud<br/>

Shall rest by day, a fiery gleam by night;<br/>

Save when they journey, and at length they come,<br/>

Conducted by his Angel, to the land<br/>

Promised to Abraham and his seed:—The rest<br/>

Were long to tell; how many battles fought<br/>

How many kings destroyed; and kingdoms won;<br/>

Or how the sun shall in mid Heaven stand still<br/>

A day entire, and night's due course adjourn,<br/>

Man's voice commanding, "Sun, in Gibeon stand,<br/>

And thou moon in the vale of Aialon,<br/>

Till Israel overcome!" so call the third<br/>

From Abraham, son of Isaac; and from him<br/>

His whole descent, who thus shall Canaan win.<br/>

Here Adam interposed.  O sent from Heaven,<br/>

Enlightener of my darkness, gracious things<br/>

Thou hast revealed; those chiefly, which concern<br/>

Just Abraham and his seed: now first I find<br/>

Mine eyes true-opening, and my heart much eased;<br/>

Erewhile perplexed with thoughts, what would become<br/>

Of me and all mankind:  But now I see<br/>

His day, in whom all nations shall be blest;<br/>

Favour unmerited by me, who sought<br/>

Forbidden knowledge by forbidden means.<br/>

This yet I apprehend not, why to those<br/>

Among whom God will deign to dwell on earth<br/>

So many and so various laws are given;<br/>

So many laws argue so many sins<br/>

Among them; how can God with such reside?<br/>

To whom thus Michael.  Doubt not but that sin<br/>

Will reign among them, as of thee begot;<br/>

And therefore was law given them, to evince<br/>

Their natural pravity, by stirring up<br/>

Sin against law to fight: that when they see<br/>

Law can discover sin, but not remove,<br/>

Save by those shadowy expiations weak,<br/>

The blood of bulls and goats, they may conclude<br/>

Some blood more precious must be paid for Man;<br/>

Just for unjust; that, in such righteousness<br/>

To them by faith imputed, they may find<br/>

Justification towards God, and peace<br/>

Of conscience; which the law by ceremonies<br/>

Cannot appease; nor Man the mortal part<br/>

Perform; and, not performing, cannot live.<br/>

So law appears imperfect; and but given<br/>

With purpose to resign them, in full time,<br/>

Up to a better covenant; disciplined<br/>

From shadowy types to truth; from flesh to spirit;<br/>

From imposition of strict laws to free<br/>

Acceptance of large grace; from servile fear<br/>

To filial; works of law to works of faith.<br/>

And therefore shall not Moses, though of God<br/>

Highly beloved, being but the minister<br/>

Of law, his people into Canaan lead;<br/>

But Joshua, whom the Gentiles Jesus call,<br/>

His name and office bearing, who shall quell<br/>

The adversary-Serpent, and bring back<br/>

Through the world's wilderness long-wandered Man<br/>

Safe to eternal Paradise of rest.<br/>

Mean while they, in their earthly Canaan placed,<br/>

Long time shall dwell and prosper, but when sins<br/>

National interrupt their publick peace,<br/>

Provoking God to raise them enemies;<br/>

From whom as oft he saves them penitent<br/>

By Judges first, then under Kings; of whom<br/>

The second, both for piety renowned<br/>

And puissant deeds, a promise shall receive<br/>

Irrevocable, that his regal throne<br/>

For ever shall endure; the like shall sing<br/>

All Prophecy, that of the royal stock<br/>

Of David (so I name this king) shall rise<br/>

A Son, the Woman's seed to thee foretold,<br/>

Foretold to Abraham, as in whom shall trust<br/>

All nations; and to kings foretold, of kings<br/>

The last; for of his reign shall be no end.<br/>

But first, a long succession must ensue;<br/>

And his next son, for wealth and wisdom famed,<br/>

The clouded ark of God, till then in tents<br/>

Wandering, shall in a glorious temple enshrine.<br/>

Such follow him, as shall be registered<br/>

Part good, part bad; of bad the longer scroll;<br/>

Whose foul idolatries, and other faults<br/>

Heaped to the popular sum, will so incense<br/>

God, as to leave them, and expose their land,<br/>

Their city, his temple, and his holy ark,<br/>

With all his sacred things, a scorn and prey<br/>

To that proud city, whose high walls thou sawest<br/>

Left in confusion; Babylon thence called.<br/>

There in captivity he lets them dwell<br/>

The space of seventy years; then brings them back,<br/>

Remembering mercy, and his covenant sworn<br/>

To David, stablished as the days of Heaven.<br/>

Returned from Babylon by leave of kings<br/>

Their lords, whom God disposed, the house of God<br/>

They first re-edify; and for a while<br/>

In mean estate live moderate; till, grown<br/>

In wealth and multitude, factious they grow;<br/>

But first among the priests dissention springs,<br/>

Men who attend the altar, and should most<br/>

Endeavour peace: their strife pollution brings<br/>

Upon the temple itself: at last they seise<br/>

The scepter, and regard not David's sons;<br/>

Then lose it to a stranger, that the true<br/>

Anointed King Messiah might be born<br/>

Barred of his right; yet at his birth a star,<br/>

Unseen before in Heaven, proclaims him come;<br/>

And guides the eastern sages, who inquire<br/>

His place, to offer incense, myrrh, and gold:<br/>

His place of birth a solemn Angel tells<br/>

To simple shepherds, keeping watch by night;<br/>

They gladly thither haste, and by a quire<br/>

Of squadroned Angels hear his carol sung.<br/>

A virgin is his mother, but his sire<br/>

The power of the Most High:  He shall ascend<br/>

The throne hereditary, and bound his reign<br/>

With Earth's wide bounds, his glory with the Heavens.<br/>

He ceased, discerning Adam with such joy<br/>

Surcharged, as had like grief been dewed in tears,<br/>

Without the vent of words; which these he breathed.<br/>

O prophet of glad tidings, finisher<br/>

Of utmost hope! now clear I understand<br/>

What oft my steadiest thoughts have searched in vain;<br/>

Why our great Expectation should be called<br/>

The seed of Woman:  Virgin Mother, hail,<br/>

High in the love of Heaven; yet from my loins<br/>

Thou shalt proceed, and from thy womb the Son<br/>

Of God Most High: so God with Man unites!<br/>

Needs must the Serpent now his capital bruise<br/>

Expect with mortal pain:  Say where and when<br/>

Their fight, what stroke shall bruise the victor's heel.<br/>

To whom thus Michael.  Dream not of their fight,<br/>

As of a duel, or the local wounds<br/>

Of head or heel:  Not therefore joins the Son<br/>

Manhood to Godhead, with more strength to foil<br/>

Thy enemy; nor so is overcome<br/>

Satan, whose fall from Heaven, a deadlier bruise,<br/>

Disabled, not to give thee thy death's wound:<br/>

Which he, who comes thy Saviour, shall recure,<br/>

Not by destroying Satan, but his works<br/>

In thee, and in thy seed:  Nor can this be,<br/>

But by fulfilling that which thou didst want,<br/>

Obedience to the law of God, imposed<br/>

On penalty of death, and suffering death;<br/>

The penalty to thy transgression due,<br/>

And due to theirs which out of thine will grow:<br/>

So only can high Justice rest appaid.<br/>

The law of God exact he shall fulfil<br/>

Both by obedience and by love, though love<br/>

Alone fulfil the law; thy punishment<br/>

He shall endure, by coming in the flesh<br/>

To a reproachful life, and cursed death;<br/>

Proclaiming life to all who shall believe<br/>

In his redemption; and that his obedience,<br/>

Imputed, becomes theirs by faith; his merits<br/>

To save them, not their own, though legal, works.<br/>

For this he shall live hated, be blasphemed,<br/>

Seised on by force, judged, and to death condemned<br/>

A shameful and accursed, nailed to the cross<br/>

By his own nation; slain for bringing life:<br/>

But to the cross he nails thy enemies,<br/>

The law that is against thee, and the sins<br/>

Of all mankind, with him there crucified,<br/>

Never to hurt them more who rightly trust<br/>

In this his satisfaction; so he dies,<br/>

But soon revives; Death over him no power<br/>

Shall long usurp; ere the third dawning light<br/>

Return, the stars of morn shall see him rise<br/>

Out of his grave, fresh as the dawning light,<br/>

Thy ransom paid, which Man from death redeems,<br/>

His death for Man, as many as offered life<br/>

Neglect not, and the benefit embrace<br/>

By faith not void of works:  This God-like act<br/>

Annuls thy doom, the death thou shouldest have died,<br/>

In sin for ever lost from life; this act<br/>

Shall bruise the head of Satan, crush his strength,<br/>

Defeating Sin and Death, his two main arms;<br/>

And fix far deeper in his head their stings<br/>

Than temporal death shall bruise the victor's heel,<br/>

Or theirs whom he redeems; a death, like sleep,<br/>

A gentle wafting to immortal life.<br/>

Nor after resurrection shall he stay<br/>

Longer on earth, than certain times to appear<br/>

To his disciples, men who in his life<br/>

Still followed him; to them shall leave in charge<br/>

To teach all nations what of him they learned<br/>

And his salvation; them who shall believe<br/>

Baptizing in the profluent stream, the sign<br/>

Of washing them from guilt of sin to life<br/>

Pure, and in mind prepared, if so befall,<br/>

For death, like that which the Redeemer died.<br/>

All nations they shall teach; for, from that day,<br/>

Not only to the sons of Abraham's loins<br/>

Salvation shall be preached, but to the sons<br/>

Of Abraham's faith wherever through the world;<br/>

So in his seed all nations shall be blest.<br/>

Then to the Heaven of Heavens he shall ascend<br/>

With victory, triumphing through the air<br/>

Over his foes and thine; there shall surprise<br/>

The Serpent, prince of air, and drag in chains<br/>

Through all his realm, and there confounded leave;<br/>

Then enter into glory, and resume<br/>

His seat at God's right hand, exalted high<br/>

Above all names in Heaven; and thence shall come,<br/>

When this world's dissolution shall be ripe,<br/>

With glory and power to judge both quick and dead;<br/>

To judge the unfaithful dead, but to reward<br/>

His faithful, and receive them into bliss,<br/>

Whether in Heaven or Earth; for then the Earth<br/>

Shall all be Paradise, far happier place<br/>

Than this of Eden, and far happier days.<br/>

So spake the Arch-Angel Michael; then paused,<br/>

As at the world's great period; and our sire,<br/>

Replete with joy and wonder, thus replied.<br/>

O Goodness infinite, Goodness immense!<br/>

That all this good of evil shall produce,<br/>

And evil turn to good; more wonderful<br/>

Than that which by creation first brought forth<br/>

Light out of darkness!  Full of doubt I stand,<br/>

Whether I should repent me now of sin<br/>

By me done, and occasioned; or rejoice<br/>

Much more, that much more good thereof shall spring;<br/>

To God more glory, more good-will to Men<br/>

From God, and over wrath grace shall abound.<br/>

But say, if our Deliverer up to Heaven<br/>

Must re-ascend, what will betide the few<br/>

His faithful, left among the unfaithful herd,<br/>

The enemies of truth?  Who then shall guide<br/>

His people, who defend?  Will they not deal<br/>

Worse with his followers than with him they dealt?<br/>

Be sure they will, said the Angel; but from Heaven<br/>

He to his own a Comforter will send,<br/>

The promise of the Father, who shall dwell<br/>

His Spirit within them; and the law of faith,<br/>

Working through love, upon their hearts shall write,<br/>

To guide them in all truth; and also arm<br/>

With spiritual armour, able to resist<br/>

Satan's assaults, and quench his fiery darts;<br/>

What man can do against them, not afraid,<br/>

Though to the death; against such cruelties<br/>

With inward consolations recompensed,<br/>

And oft supported so as shall amaze<br/>

Their proudest persecutors:  For the Spirit,<br/>

Poured first on his Apostles, whom he sends<br/>

To evangelize the nations, then on all<br/>

Baptized, shall them with wonderous gifts endue<br/>

To speak all tongues, and do all miracles,<br/>

As did their Lord before them.  Thus they win<br/>

Great numbers of each nation to receive<br/>

With joy the tidings brought from Heaven:  At length<br/>

Their ministry performed, and race well run,<br/>

Their doctrine and their story written left,<br/>

They die; but in their room, as they forewarn,<br/>

Wolves shall succeed for teachers, grievous wolves,<br/>

Who all the sacred mysteries of Heaven<br/>

To their own vile advantages shall turn<br/>

Of lucre and ambition; and the truth<br/>

With superstitions and traditions taint,<br/>

Left only in those written records pure,<br/>

Though not but by the Spirit understood.<br/>

Then shall they seek to avail themselves of names,<br/>

Places, and titles, and with these to join<br/>

Secular power; though feigning still to act<br/>

By spiritual, to themselves appropriating<br/>

The Spirit of God, promised alike and given<br/>

To all believers; and, from that pretence,<br/>

Spiritual laws by carnal power shall force<br/>

On every conscience; laws which none shall find<br/>

Left them inrolled, or what the Spirit within<br/>

Shall on the heart engrave.  What will they then<br/>

But force the Spirit of Grace itself, and bind<br/>

His consort Liberty? what, but unbuild<br/>

His living temples, built by faith to stand,<br/>

Their own faith, not another's? for, on earth,<br/>

Who against faith and conscience can be heard<br/>

Infallible? yet many will presume:<br/>

Whence heavy persecution shall arise<br/>

On all, who in the worship persevere<br/>

Of spirit and truth; the rest, far greater part,<br/>

Will deem in outward rites and specious forms<br/>

Religion satisfied; Truth shall retire<br/>

Bestuck with slanderous darts, and works of faith<br/>

Rarely be found:  So shall the world go on,<br/>

To good malignant, to bad men benign;<br/>

Under her own weight groaning; till the day<br/>

Appear of respiration to the just,<br/>

And vengeance to the wicked, at return<br/>

Of him so lately promised to thy aid,<br/>

The Woman's Seed; obscurely then foretold,<br/>

Now ampler known thy Saviour and thy Lord;<br/>

Last, in the clouds, from Heaven to be revealed<br/>

In glory of the Father, to dissolve<br/>

Satan with his perverted world; then raise<br/>

From the conflagrant mass, purged and refined,<br/>

New Heavens, new Earth, ages of endless date,<br/>

Founded in righteousness, and peace, and love;<br/>

To bring forth fruits, joy and eternal bliss.<br/>

He ended; and thus Adam last replied.<br/>

How soon hath thy prediction, Seer blest,<br/>

Measured this transient world, the race of time,<br/>

Till time stand fixed!  Beyond is all abyss,<br/>

Eternity, whose end no eye can reach.<br/>

Greatly-instructed I shall hence depart;<br/>

Greatly in peace of thought; and have my fill<br/>

Of knowledge, what this vessel can contain;<br/>

Beyond which was my folly to aspire.<br/>

Henceforth I learn, that to obey is best,<br/>

And love with fear the only God; to walk<br/>

As in his presence; ever to observe<br/>

His providence; and on him sole depend,<br/>

Merciful over all his works, with good<br/>

Still overcoming evil, and by small<br/>

Accomplishing great things, by things deemed weak<br/>

Subverting worldly strong, and worldly wise<br/>

By simply meek: that suffering for truth's sake<br/>

Is fortitude to highest victory,<br/>

And, to the faithful, death the gate of life;<br/>

Taught this by his example, whom I now<br/>

Acknowledge my Redeemer ever blest.<br/>

To whom thus also the Angel last replied.<br/>

This having learned, thou hast attained the sum<br/>

Of wisdom; hope no higher, though all the stars<br/>

Thou knewest by name, and all the ethereal powers,<br/>

All secrets of the deep, all Nature's works,<br/>

Or works of God in Heaven, air, earth, or sea,<br/>

And all the riches of this world enjoyedst,<br/>

And all the rule, one empire; only add<br/>

Deeds to thy knowledge answerable; add faith,<br/>

Add virtue, patience, temperance; add love,<br/>

By name to come called charity, the soul<br/>

Of all the rest: then wilt thou not be loth<br/>

To leave this Paradise, but shalt possess<br/>

A Paradise within thee, happier far.—<br/>

Let us descend now therefore from this top<br/>

Of speculation; for the hour precise<br/>

Exacts our parting hence; and see the guards,<br/>

By me encamped on yonder hill, expect<br/>

Their motion; at whose front a flaming sword,<br/>

In signal of remove, waves fiercely round:<br/>

We may no longer stay: go, waken Eve;<br/>

Her also I with gentle dreams have calmed<br/>

Portending good, and all her spirits composed<br/>

To meek submission: thou, at season fit,<br/>

Let her with thee partake what thou hast heard;<br/>

Chiefly what may concern her faith to know,<br/>

The great deliverance by her seed to come<br/>

(For by the Woman's seed) on all mankind:<br/>

That ye may live, which will be many days,<br/>

Both in one faith unanimous, though sad,<br/>

With cause, for evils past; yet much more cheered<br/>

With meditation on the happy end.<br/>

He ended, and they both descend the hill;<br/>

Descended, Adam to the bower, where Eve<br/>

Lay sleeping, ran before; but found her waked;<br/>

And thus with words not sad she him received.<br/>

Whence thou returnest, and whither wentest, I know;<br/>

For God is also in sleep; and dreams advise,<br/>

Which he hath sent propitious, some great good<br/>

Presaging, since with sorrow and heart's distress<br/>

Wearied I fell asleep:  But now lead on;<br/>

In me is no delay; with thee to go,<br/>

Is to stay here; without thee here to stay,<br/>

Is to go hence unwilling; thou to me<br/>

Art all things under Heaven, all places thou,<br/>

Who for my wilful crime art banished hence.<br/>

This further consolation yet secure<br/>

I carry hence; though all by me is lost,<br/>

Such favour I unworthy am vouchsafed,<br/>

By me the Promised Seed shall all restore.<br/>

So spake our mother Eve; and Adam heard<br/>

Well pleased, but answered not:  For now, too nigh<br/>

The Arch-Angel stood; and, from the other hill<br/>

To their fixed station, all in bright array<br/>

The Cherubim descended; on the ground<br/>

Gliding meteorous, as evening-mist<br/>

Risen from a river o'er the marish glides,<br/>

And gathers ground fast at the labourer's heel<br/>

Homeward returning.  High in front advanced,<br/>

The brandished sword of God before them blazed,<br/>

Fierce as a comet; which with torrid heat,<br/>

And vapour as the Libyan air adust,<br/>

Began to parch that temperate clime; whereat<br/>

In either hand the hastening Angel caught<br/>

Our lingering parents, and to the eastern gate<br/>

Led them direct, and down the cliff as fast<br/>

To the subjected plain; then disappeared.<br/>

They, looking back, all the eastern side beheld<br/>

Of Paradise, so late their happy seat,<br/>

Waved over by that flaming brand; the gate<br/>

With dreadful faces thronged, and fiery arms:<br/>

Some natural tears they dropt, but wiped them soon;<br/>

The world was all before them, where to choose<br/>

Their place of rest, and Providence their guide:<br/>

They, hand in hand, with wandering steps and slow,<br/>

Through Eden took their solitary way.<br/>
